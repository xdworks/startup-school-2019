# Kevin Hale - How to Improve Conversion Rates


Kevin Hale:So this presentation on improving conversion rates, it's designed to mostly focus on like landing  pages.

凯文·黑尔：所以这个关于提高转化率的演示文稿，旨在主要关注登陆页面。

But all of the principles and ideas that I'll talk about in this talk  actually can help you improve the conversion rates of almost anything, any user interface.

但我将在这次演讲中谈到的所有原则和想法实际上可以帮助你提高几乎任何东西，任何用户界面的转换率。

So  keep that in mind.

所以记住这一点。

This is a typical example, conversion rate funnel, and when you're  trying to improve in conversion rate, you're basically, you're trying to improve the efficiency of  going from one step to the next.

这是一个典型的例子，转化率漏斗，当你试图提高转化率时，你基本上是在试图提高从一个步骤到下一个步骤的效率。

And the thing is, why we care about  conversion rate is because it's part of two different aspects of growth.

问题是，我们之所以关心转化率，是因为它是增长的两个不同方面的一部分。

The two main  sort of drivers.

两种主要的驱动程序。

And so growth is the balance between conversion and churn.

因此，增长是转换和流失之间的平衡。

And basically  growth happens as a gap between the two.

基本上，增长是作为两者之间的差距发生的。

Something to keep in mind is that  working on churn is actually much easier than working on conversion.

需要记住的一点是，处理混杂实际上要比处理转换容易得多。

So in this talk  we're working on the harder thing.

所以在这个演讲中，我们要做的是更难的事情。

It's the thing that [inaudible] are going to get  started.

这是[听不见]将要开始的事情。

When I talk to a company and I'm trying to help them with their  conversion rates, the first thing I usually try to figure out is do we even  need to be working on this at all? So the only time you should be  working on and improving your conversion rate is because you have a leaky bucket.

当我与一家公司交谈时，我试图帮助他们提高转化率，我通常首先要弄清楚的是，我们是否需要在这方面进行工作？因此，唯一的时间，你应该在工作和提高您的转换率是因为你有一个漏水的桶。

So  I'd like to just talk about a couple of benchmarks in the industry so that  we all kind of sit on the same page and understand whether we should be  working on this or working on something else, like putting more things into the top  of the funnel.

所以我只想谈谈行业中的几个基准，这样我们就可以坐在同一个页面上，了解我们是应该在这方面工作，还是在其他方面工作，比如把更多的东西放在漏斗的顶端。

Shareware, conversion of rate here is about 0.5%.

共享软件，这里的转换率是0.5%左右。

So basically, this is  old school like before the internet.

所以基本上，这是老派，就像互联网之前一样。

If people just release software out for free and  they just hope that somebody will pay for it out of their own goodwill.

如果人们只是免费发布软件，他们只是希望有人会出于他们自己的善意而付费。

This  is the conversion rate you can expect.

这是您可以预期的转换率。

Casual download games, it's about 2%.

随便下载游戏，大约是2%。

So stuff  that you sort of play on and off while waiting in line.

所以当你排队的时候，你可以断断续续地播放一些东西。

Most companies care  about this one freemium software as a service companies, they range between 1.5 and 5%.

大多数公司关心这一免费增值软件作为服务公司，他们的范围在1.5%到5%之间。

 On average it's about 3%.

平均约为3%。

So once I talk to a company and they have  pages that are converting at about 3% and that is from out of 100 visitors  that visit your page, two to 3% sign up, I usually say you probably don't  need to spend that much more time on this.

所以，一旦我与一家公司交谈，他们的页面的转化率约为3%，这是来自访问你的页面的100名访问者中的2%到3%的注册，我通常会说你可能不需要在这上面花费更多的时间。

There's probably other things you should  work on instead.

也许你应该做些其他的事情来取而代之。

That being said, you can do much better than that.

话虽如此，你可以做得更好。

Flicker, back  in the heyday had a conversion rate between five and 10%.

闪烁，在全盛时期有一个转换率在5%到10%之间。

Adult FriendFinder, So depending  on what you're selling, people wanted a whole lot more.

成人FriendFinder，所以根据你卖的是什么，人们想要更多。

So 10 to 22% for  sex and end of loneliness.

所以10%到22%的性生活和结束孤独。

Even better.

甚至更好。

So these are, if you don't recognize them,  children social networks and so basically this is the conversion rate to get your kid  to shut the fuck up, right? To leave you alone.

所以这些是，如果你不认识他们，儿童社交网络，所以基本上这就是让你的孩子他妈的闭嘴的转换率，对吧？让你一个人呆着。

Turbo Tax online, the monster  70% conversion rate.

涡轮增值税在线，怪物70%转化率。

Basically you're going to turbo tax, you're downloading that software, you are  paying for it.

基本上你会去涡轮增值税，你正在下载那个软件，你正在为它付费。

It is very, very high intact.

它完好无损的非常高。

Every conversion rate problem looks like  every other user interface problem and the concept or framework that I like to use  to explain how to solve any user interface problem is using something called the Knowledge  Spectrum.

每个转换率问题看起来都像其他用户界面问题一样，我喜欢用来解释如何解决任何用户界面问题的概念或框架是使用称为知识频谱的东西。

This was created by amazing interface designer name, Jared Spool and basically the Knowledge  Spectrum says that this represents all knowledge on a spectrum and on this side represents  zero knowledge, no knowledge, you don't know anything and on the other side is God-like,  all knowledge.

这是由令人惊叹的界面设计师Jared Spool创建的，基本上知识频谱说这代表了频谱上的所有知识，这边代表零知识，没有知识，你什么都不知道，另一边是上帝般的，所有的知识。

Your product and your user sits on two points on that line.

你的产品和你的用户坐在那条线上的两个点上。

Just  two dimensions.

只有两个维度。

Your user sits here at what we call the current knowledge point and  your interface, your landing page, the thing you want them to do is it's here  at the target knowledge point.

你的用户坐在这里，我们称之为当前知识点和你的界面，你的登陆页面，你想让他们做的事情就是在这里的目标知识点。

And every interface problem that's trying to be solved is  trying to close what we call the knowledge gap.

每个试图解决的界面问题都试图弥合我们所说的知识鸿沟。

That's it.

就这样。

You don't need to  go to a complicated design school to know how to solve these problems.

你不需要去复杂的设计学校才能知道如何解决这些问题。

You either  are going to increase the amount of knowledge that is needed by your user or  you need to decrease the amount of knowledge needed to use your product or interface.

您要么要增加用户所需的知识量，要么需要减少使用产品或界面所需的知识量。

 That's it.

就这样。

Whenever I'm looking at anyone's design problem, I'm trying to figure out do  I need to increase knowledge or do I need to decrease it? So the most  helpful exercise that I will use from this, once I understand this concept when I'm  trying to design a landing page or to improve it, is to simplify things very,  very simply.

每当我看到任何人的设计问题时，我都在试图弄清楚我是需要增加知识还是需要减少知识？因此，在我尝试设计或改进登录页面时，一旦我理解了这个概念，我将使用的最有帮助的练习是将事情简化得非常简单。

And what I imagine is something called the one button interface.

我想象的是一种叫做一键式界面的东西。

So let's  imagine that we reduced our landing page, our product to just one button on a  page.

所以让我们想象一下，我们把我们的登陆页面，我们的产品减少到一个页面上的一个按钮。

The question becomes, what do I have to put on this page to get  someone to push the button? What's the minimum amount? That's what you ideally want to  have on there.

问题变成了，我必须在这个页面上放什么才能让别人按下按钮？最低限额是多少？这就是你理想中想要的东西。

And is there any information that I put on this page that  keeps me from pushing the button or is there any lack of information that keeps  me from pushing the button? Now for every time that I deal with any page  that I'm looking at that I'm trying to help improve, I basically go through a  series of seven questions, for every single one.

我放在这个页面上的任何信息让我无法按下按钮，或者是否缺少任何信息让我无法按下按钮？现在，每当我处理我正在查看的、我试图帮助改进的任何页面时，我基本上都会经历一系列的七个问题，每个问题都是这样的。

And then through the series of seven  questions, I look very smart.

然后通过一系列的七个问题，我看起来非常聪明。

You now can be smart on your own.

你现在可以自己变聪明了。

The first  question I ask is, what's the call to action? Is the button, is the thing  I most want my user to do? Is it super obvious? Where do I find  it? And the thing to keep in mind about the call to action is it  should be really, really close to a concept I like to call the magic moment.

我问的第一个问题是，行动的号召是什么？是按钮，是我最希望我的用户做的事情吗？这是不是很明显？我在哪里能找到它？关于行动号召，需要记住的是它应该非常接近一个我喜欢称之为神奇时刻的概念。

 The magic moment is basically the experience, the knowledge, the information, the interaction that someone  has with your startup, and all of a sudden they get tingling and inside the  light bulb goes off and they go, "Holy fuck.

这个神奇的时刻基本上就是某人与你的创业公司之间的经验，知识，信息，互动，突然之间，他们感到刺痛，灯泡内部熄灭了，他们说，“他妈的太棒了。”

I've been waiting for this my  whole life.

我这辈子都在等这个。

I now get it.

我现在明白了。

This is super exciting.

这太令人兴奋了。

I can't wait to use  this." And your call to action should be as close to that magic moment as  possible.

我迫不及待地想使用这个。“而你的行动号召应该尽可能接近那个神奇的时刻。

That when I click that button, I'm going to be taken to that point.

当我点击那个按钮时，我会被带到那个点。

 So often I go through a design critique with someone and I'm like, "What's your  magic moment?" And then somehow the call to action is like 27 steps away from  whatever it is that makes someone feel special or gets really excited about your product  or app.

所以我经常和某人一起经历设计评论，我想，“你的神奇时刻是什么？”然后，不知何故，行动号召就像是距离任何让人感到特别或对你的产品或应用程序真正感到兴奋的东西相距27步之遥。

So you should be as close to zero as possible from your call  to action.

因此，你应该尽可能接近零，从你的行动号召。

The six other questions we're going to go through relatively quickly and then  we're going to go through two examples from people participating in startup school to just  watch them in action.

其他六个问题，我们将相对快速地讲完，然后我们将通过两个例子，来自参与创业学校的人，只是观察他们的行动。

The next question is, what is this? What is this magic  moment, right? And my tests for this, my lips ...

下一个问题是，这是什么？这个神奇的时刻是什么，对吧？我的测试，我的嘴唇.。

My test is like, can  I just copy paste a sentence on this page, the landing page that I can  put into an email and send it to my mom and my mom goes, "I  understand what this is." 99% of the time I look at people's websites and they're  so filled with MBA marketing jargon and talk that there's no sentence that exists on  that page that it lets me to very clearly understand what it is that this  company does.

我的测试是这样的，我能不能复制粘贴一句话到这个页面上，我可以把登陆页面放到电子邮件中发送给我妈妈，我妈妈会说，“我明白这是什么。”99%的时间我浏览人们的网站，他们充满了MBA营销术语和谈话，页面上没有任何句子，它让我非常清楚地了解这家公司是做什么的。(这句话的意思是“我明白这是怎么回事”。

Is it right for me? So people who are super in a rush,  impatient trying to solve their problems, they're quickly trying to identify themselves.

对我合适吗？所以那些急于解决问题，急于解决问题的人，他们很快就会试图表明自己的身份。

This is like,  am I in the wrong place? Is this the right product? And the way they're  trying to determine that is see like is there any reflection of themselves in this  or any reflection of their problems? Look at it anywhere on the page.

这就像是，我是不是走错地方了？这是正确的产品吗？他们试图确定这一点的方式是看，在这件事上有没有反映他们自己的情况，或者他们的问题有什么反映？在页面上的任何地方都可以看到它。

Is it  legit? So the threshold is very low here.

合法吗？所以门槛很低。

Just can't look like a Russian spamming  website.

只是不能看起来像俄罗斯的垃圾邮件网站。

Right? Outside of that, you don't need to overthink this.

对吗？除此之外，你不需要想太多。

Thanks to tons of  templates and themes out there.

多亏了大量的模板和主题。

You should be able to get over this bar very,  very quickly.

你应该能够非常快地通过这个酒吧。

Who else is using it? So a lot of people are uncomfortable using  a product unless they know that there's something else out there and you might think  it's a variation of legit, but again, this bar is completely different.

还有谁在使用它？所以很多人使用一个产品会感到不舒服，除非他们知道有其他东西在那里，你可能会认为它是合法的变体，但同样，这个酒吧是完全不同的。

It's letting me  know, "Oh a shortcut for is it right for me and is it legit?" And  basically a shortcut for trust.

它让我知道，“哦，这是我的捷径吗？它合法吗？”基本上是信任的捷径。

And people often are trying to say like, "Oh, if  so and so is already using this, then I should actually give this a chance."  How much is it? What's the catch? This is the one that so many B2B  enterprise, companies are afraid to put on their website.

人们经常试图说，“哦，如果某某已经在使用这个，那么我应该给它一个机会。”多少钱？有什么窍门？这是一个如此之多的B2B企业，公司都不敢放在他们的网站上。

Which is why we've paired this  talk up with pricing.

这就是为什么我们把这个话题和定价结合起来。

And basically you should have some empathy.

基本上你应该有一些同理心。

How many times do  you go to a website and go like, "ell I'll use this without knowing how  much it costs.

有多少次你会去一个网站，然后说，“好吧，我会使用这个，但不知道它要花多少钱。”

Sounds good to me.

听起来不错。

Let's just do it." No one does that,  and so you shouldn't be surprised that your conversion rates are affected because you don't  tell people how much it costs or what's the catch.

我们就这么做吧。“没有人这样做，所以你不应该对你的转化率受到影响感到惊讶，因为你没有告诉人们它的成本是多少，或者有什么收获。

So let's say you're giving  away something for free and really your business models, you make money some other way.

所以，假设你免费赠送一些东西，实际上是你的商业模式，你通过其他方式赚钱。

 You should explain that to people because otherwise people feel paranoid or worried or feel  kind of weird.

你应该向人们解释这一点，因为否则人们会感到疑神疑鬼或担心，或者感觉有点怪异。

And then lastly is where can I get help? There's always a  percentage of users who go to your website and it doesn't matter that you have  all the FAQs, you've written everything down, you've created these few beautiful video documentation, they  will just go like, "I just want to ask someone.

最后一个问题是我在哪里可以得到帮助？总是有一定比例的用户访问你的网站，不管你有没有所有的FAQ，你已经写下了所有的东西，你创建了这几个漂亮的视频文档，他们会说，“我只是想问某人。

I just need to talk  to somebody.

我只是需要找个人谈谈。

I need someone to tell me directly." And part of it is some  people are just like, "I just want to see if there's a real person behind  this." That's number one, or some people just can't be bothered and sometimes it's easier  for them to just directly ask then navigate through the website.

我需要有人直接告诉我。“部分原因是有些人会说，”我只是想看看这件事背后有没有一个真正的人。“这是第一，或者有些人就是不能被打扰，有时他们直接询问然后浏览网站会更容易。

And if you don't  make it really easy to find and contact you or make it look like that  you were going to help them, if they start using the product, they probably won't  use it.

如果你不能很容易地找到和联系你，或者让它看起来像是你要帮助他们，如果他们开始使用这个产品，他们可能就不会使用它了。

This talk is so short.

这个演讲太短了。

So that's basically it.

基本上就是这样。

Those are the seven  questions.

这就是七个问题。

We are now going to go through two examples of startup school companies that  sent their stuff to me and I don't really have their permission, but they did  submit it when they asked to have a design critique done in the startup school  forums.

我们现在要看两个创业学校公司把他们的东西发给我的例子，我真的没有得到他们的许可，但他们确实提交了，当他们要求在创业学校论坛上做设计评论时。

So I feel like we're going to be okay.

所以我觉得我们会没事的

Okay.

好吧。

So the first one  we're going to do is meetingroom.io.

因此，我们要做的第一个是Meetingroom.io。

All right.

好的。

First question, what is the call to  action? What is it that this company most wants me to do? And then what  I do is I basically then try to do that thing and just follow it  all the way through and just see how far away am I from the magic  moment.

第一个问题，行动的号召是什么？这家公司最希望我做的是什么？然后我所做的基本上就是我试着去做那件事，然后跟着它一直走到最后，看看我离那个神奇的时刻有多远。

So these guys create virtual meeting room platforms, so basically we don't have a  copy paste on this, but basically it's like you want to meet in VR space  with someone.

所以这些人创建了虚拟会议室平台，所以基本上我们没有复制粘贴，但基本上就像你想要在VR空间里和某人见面一样。

You can use this to help create that space and create that sort  of meeting.

您可以使用它来帮助创建该空间，并创建那种会议。

Imagine it is, get a virtual room right now.

想象一下，现在就得到一个虚拟房间。

There's a lot of  things that are sort of competing with it for all the call to actions on  this page, and then we don't repeat it down here.

在这个页面上，有很多东西在与它竞争所有的行动号召，然后我们在这里不再重复它了。

That reminds me where to  go.

这提醒了我该去哪里。

So let's go to the most efficient, get a virtual meeting room right now.

所以让我们去最高效的地方，现在就得到一个虚拟的会议室。

 And then on here we have competing calls to actions to download, and then we  have managed rooms.

然后在这里，我们有竞争的行动号召下载，然后我们有管理室。

And then there's a start here to get to your virtual room,  which is a carousel that walks you through seven steps to finally get to making  a room.

然后这里有一个开始进入你的虚拟房间，这是一个旋转木马，带你通过七个步骤，最终得到一个房间。

But none of these are the actual forms to do it.

但这些都不是实现这一目的实际形式。

So you  have to then go here and then hopefully you will remember all of those seven  steps in the carousel and then you'll walk all the way through it.

所以你必须走到这里，然后希望你能记住旋转木马中的所有七个步骤，然后你会一路走过去。

So things  that I would recommend would be like I want to have always one button.

所以我推荐的东西就像我希望总是有一个按钮。

That's  a very, very clear.

这是非常清楚的。

That is what I want you to do on any given  page.

这就是我希望你在任何给定的页面上做的事情。

Number two, I don't think this makes it easy to understand and I can't  keep it in my head to follow.

第二，我不认为这使它容易理解，我不能把它留在我的脑海中跟随。

It's good that they know all the steps,  but I would probably imagine that there's something that's going to help me experience that  magic moment much sooner.

他们知道所有的步骤是好的，但我可能会想象有什么东西会帮助我更快地体验那神奇的时刻。

And what I imagine is that magic moment happens when I  finally make a booking and I meet with someone in a room together and we  start interacting and we're solving something.

我想象的是神奇的时刻发生了，当我最终预订房间，我和一个房间里的人见面，我们开始互动，我们正在解决一些问题。

And I feel like if I can't do that  right away, then I want to have them be able to experience it some way.

我觉得如果我不能马上做到这一点，那么我希望他们能够以某种方式体验到这一点。

 So I would totally add some kind of video, I think they have that here.

所以我完全会添加一些视频，我认为他们在这里有这样的视频。

 They'll kind of show it off.

他们会有点炫耀的。

This video is kind of long and it doesn't  get us to that magical place.

这个视频有点长，它不能把我们带到那个神奇的地方。

So that's number one.

所以这是第一位。

Second, what is this? So  virtual meeting room platform, but if I copy and pasted that, I wouldn't quite know.

第二，这是什么？所以虚拟会议室平台，但如果我复制和粘贴，我不会很清楚。

 Also you see this carousels kind of moving around.

你还可以看到这个旋转木马在四处移动。

Carousels don't work very well because  you're hiding information that I might want to have to answer any one of my  seven questions.

旋转木马不能很好地工作，因为你隐藏了我可能需要回答我七个问题中的任何一个问题的信息。

And secondly, Oh God, I can't figure it out ...

其次，天哪，我搞不懂.

We do this  thing where he calls it an open beta and so the legit part here starts  getting you affected.

我们做这件事，他称之为开放测试版，所以这里的合法部分开始让你受到影响。

It's like, "Oh I can't rely on this." And the later on  the signup page it talks about entering into the closed beta.

就像是，“哦，我不能依赖这个。”后来在注册页面上，它谈到了进入封闭的测试版。

And so these are  all things that indicate, is like I'm not ready for you to experience this.

所以这些都表明，就像我还没有准备好让你们经历这件事。

Don't  use me for any real meetings is what this telegraphs.

不要用我做任何真正的会议就是这个电报。

And so if this basically  works, would try to move that straight forward to that.

所以如果这个基本奏效的话，我会试着把它直接推向那个方向。

Down here we're trying to  look for who else is also using it.

在这里，我们试图寻找还有谁也在使用它。

So we don't have a list of  customers, instead we have a bunch of other logos here in terms of featured in  a bunch of press that we have partners, but I don't know what that means,  and then we have a bunch of awards, but none of them are actual people  using it.

所以我们没有客户名单，相反，我们在这里有一堆其他标志，在一堆媒体上我们有合作伙伴，但我不知道这意味着什么，然后我们有一系列奖项，但没有一个是真正的人在使用它。

And so it's so many logos of other things that it would make  me nervous that no one's really using this as a result.

所以它是如此多的其他东西的标志，它会让我感到紧张，因为没有人真的使用它作为结果。

And then lastly, where  do I get help? We've gotten an intercom in the lower right and then we  also have no help page, no documentation to quickly look at to see how this  works.

最后，我在哪里可以得到帮助？我们在右下角有一个对讲机，然后我们也没有帮助页面，没有文档可以快速查看，看看它是如何工作的。

And then the last one is going into pricing.

最后一个问题是定价。

So here we get to  this point and I realize, oh, okay.

所以我们到了这一点，我意识到，哦，好吧。

I see this pricing, if I need 12  people in a room, it's going to be $99 a month, and then I can  start sort of working on it.

我看到这个定价，如果我需要12个人在一个房间里，它将是99美元一个月，然后我就可以开始工作了。

And it's one page over and if I go  for the free again, we'll go through all this whole process.

它只有一页，如果我再次免费，我们将经历整个过程。

So a bunch of  little things.

所以一堆小事。

We just go through all the questions.

我们只是把所有的问题都看完了。

We're going to see a bunch  of non-optimal stuff on this page.

我们将在这个页面上看到一堆非最佳的东西。

Let's go to our second example.

让我们来看第二个例子。

It'll be a  little bit different.

会有点不同。

So this is a company called Divjoy.

这是一家名为Divjoy的公司。

And so they describe themselves  as a react codebase generator and then he has this, one description is just like  use our free web-based tool to create the perfect codebase for your next project.

所以他们把自己描述为一个反应代码库生成器，然后他有这样的描述，一个描述就像使用我们免费的基于网络的工具为你的下一个项目创建完美的代码库。

So  my first question I'm trying to figure out is like what's the call to action  he most wants me to do? And so as I scroll down this page, there's  actually nothing that looks like a giant button.

所以我想弄清楚的第一个问题是，他最想让我做的行动号召是什么？所以当我向下滚动这一页时，实际上没有任何东西看起来像一个巨大的按钮。

And actually the big thing he wants  me to do is click on one of these templates, these screenshots that are supposed  to be the button.

实际上，他想让我做的最大的事情就是点击这些模板中的一个，这些截图应该是按钮。

So we have sort of an affordance problem and then we  go into here and my magic moment is when I get over and realize it's  like, oh, it's not just like landing page templates, but it's like a dashboard.

所以我们有一个负担的问题，然后我们进入这里，我的神奇时刻是当我超过并意识到它就像，哦，它不只是像登陆页面模板，而是像一个仪表板一样。

It's  like a sign in page, a pricing page.

就像一个登录页面，一个定价页面。

It's like the entire project for building  a SAS app is all located here, which I think is really amazing and nothing  just tells me that that's what's all here.

就像构建SAS应用程序的整个项目都位于这里，我认为这真的很令人惊叹，没有什么只是告诉我这里就是这样。

And I might not find out until  I export code, and then I hit download and then I'll get the code.

我可能不知道，直到我导出代码，然后我点击下载，然后我会得到代码。

Yeah.

嗯。

 So we're so many steps away from sort of experiencing that, and also I feel  like it's so not explicit that I might miss how amazing what he's built here  is in terms of what he's offering.

所以我们离这种体验太远了，而且我觉得它太不明确了，我可能会错过他在这里建造的东西在他所提供的方面是多么令人惊叹的东西。

One thing he does kind of well is  he doesn't have logos of customers, but he has shown how many people have created  or downloaded the templates.

他做得很好的一件事是他没有客户的徽标，但他已经展示了有多少人创建或下载了模板。

So this number kind of sets it like Oh there's people  actually using this and finding it useful.

所以这个数字有点像，哦，有人在使用这个，并且发现它很有用。

Down here, he tries to get at this,  everything you need is included.

在这里，他试图做到这一点，你需要的一切都包括在内。

And then he adds all this other texts.

然后他又加上了其他所有的文字。

But all  that text is there and the odds are your users aren't going to read them.

但是所有的文本都在那里，而且很可能你的用户不会去阅读它们。

 So because it's located into that copy, it gets kind of lost.

因此，因为它位于那个副本中，所以它有点丢失了。

And then again  we have an intercom, but there's just not enough information in terms of like FAQs,  right? And about page.

然后，我们有一个对讲机，但就像FAQ一样，没有足够的信息，对吗？关于佩奇。

That just makes me go like, oh that this is more  than a side project, and so in terms of how much I can sort of  invest in this and how much I can rely on this down the road in  the future is going to be minimal.


这只会让我想，哦，这不仅仅是一个辅助项目，所以就我在这方面可以投资多少，以及我在未来可以依赖这个项目的程度而言，这将是最小的。
