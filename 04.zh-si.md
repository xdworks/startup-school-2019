# Ilya Volodarsky - Analytics for Startups

Ilya Volodarsky:Hi everyone.

伊利亚·沃罗达斯基：大家好。

My name is Ilya.

我叫伊利亚。

I'm one of the co-founders at Segment.

我是Segment的联合创始人之一。

And I'm  here to talk to you about how to set up analytics and the analytics foundation  to build your MVP, and to measure these primary and secondary metrics.

我在这里与您讨论如何建立分析和分析基础来构建您的MVP，并衡量这些主要和次要指标。

So this is  going to be a little bit more of a tactical guide around what tools are  there in the analytics space, in the marketing space, which ones should we actually be  using? How do I set them up? Cool.

因此，这将更多地是一个战术指南，关于分析空间，营销空间中有哪些工具，我们实际上应该使用哪些工具？我如何设置它们？很好。

Just before I get started, a lot  of you may not know what Segment is.

在我开始之前，很多人可能不知道Segment是什么。

It's an analytics API where you can  send analytics data, and then toggle on different tools.

这是一个分析API，您可以在其中发送分析数据，然后在不同的工具上切换。

So we sit in the cool  market position where we can actually see what tools startups are using.

所以我们坐在很酷的市场位置上，在那里我们可以看到初创公司正在使用什么工具。

And we can  bring that information to you.

我们可以把这些信息带给你。

And secondly, we've been around for about six years.

其次，我们已经有大约六年的历史了。

And  so we have information about a lot of different startups as they grew and what  tools they used.

因此，我们有很多不同的初创公司的信息，随着他们的成长，以及他们使用了什么工具。

So we're going to be sharing a lot of those today.

所以我们今天将分享很多这些。

Cool.

很好。

 So why talk about ...

那为什么要谈论.。

Why even focus on the analytics? Obviously primary and secondary  metrics drive the MVP and product market fit process.

为什么还要专注于分析呢？显然，主要和次要指标驱动MVP和产品市场匹配过程。

And you're using that to actually  test product market fit.

你正在用它来实际测试产品市场的适合性。

You're also using it once you get out of product market  fit strict search, to actually focus the team.

一旦你走出产品市场FIT严格搜索，你也会使用它，以真正集中团队。

So maybe there's going to be an  acquisition issue in the company that's preventing your growth.

因此，也许公司中会有一个阻碍你成长的收购问题。

Or maybe the users that you're  getting aren't as engaged, or maybe you're having some monetization issues.

或者可能你得到的用户不是很投入，或者你有一些货币化的问题。

And so the funnel  actually is a forcing function to understand your business and where founders should be actually  spending their time.

因此，漏斗实际上是一个强制性的功能，以了解您的业务，以及创始人实际应该把时间花在哪里。

And then finally, all the way from a two, three person team  to a Google with 1 million employees, you're actually using metrics to operate and drive  teams.

最后，从两三个人的团队到拥有一百万名员工的谷歌，你实际上是在使用指标来运营和驱动团队。

So eventually you have an engineering team, you have a marketing team.

所以最终你会有一个工程团队，你会有一个营销团队。

And so  what goal do you set in front of the marketing team? Use analytics for that.

那么你在营销团队面前设定了什么目标呢？对此使用分析。

 Okay, so today we're gonna cover a few different things.

好的，今天我们将讨论一些不同的事情。

So first you always start  with the funnel when you're thinking about analytics.

所以首先，当你考虑分析的时候，你总是从漏斗开始。

So that's the sequential series of steps  that your users go through to actually get value, and then pay you as well.

这就是用户实际获得价值，然后支付给你的一系列连续步骤。

 Then we're going to talk about collecting data for your analytics tools.

然后我们将讨论如何为您的分析工具收集数据。

Then we're going  to talk about the top three metrics.

然后我们将讨论前三个指标。

So these will include primary and secondary metrics  that work for most products.

因此，这些将包括适用于大多数产品的主要和次要指标。

And then a product market fit methodology that you can  apply on top of that.

然后，您可以在此基础上应用产品市场匹配方法。

And then finally we'll make recommendations about what tools are  the best in the market right now that help the product market fit journey.

最后，我们将推荐目前市场上最好的工具，帮助产品市场适应旅程。

Okay.

好吧。

 So to start, always start started the funnel.

因此，开始时，总是开始启动漏斗。

So we'll make an example funnel for  Netflix, which is a company that we're all super familiar with.

所以我们将为Netflix制作一个例子漏斗，这是一家我们都非常熟悉的公司。

Any B2B product or  B2C product actually has this type of funnel where you acquire a user, you engage  a user over a period of time.

任何B2B产品或B2C产品实际上都有这种类型的漏斗，在那里你获得了一个用户，你在一段时间内吸引了一个用户。

That loop is called retention.

这个循环叫做保留。

And then finally  you monetize the user.

然后最后你将用户货币化。

And then metrics, both primary and secondary are performance indicators on  top of each stage in the funnel.

然后是指标，主要和次要指标都是漏斗中每个阶段的性能指标。

So on top of acquisition you can ask  yourself, "How many net new users did I get this week versus last week? And  what's my growth rate there?" For engagement, you take a cohort of users.

因此，除了收购之外，你可以问自己，“与上周相比，本周我获得了多少净新用户？我在那里的增长率是多少？”对于参与，您需要一组用户。

So from  Sunday to the following Monday you have 16 people sign up.

所以从周日到下个星期一你有16个人注册。

And then you can  track that cohort of users week over week and see what percentage of them are  still using the product four weeks later, which is a good example of how to  track retention.

然后你可以一周地跟踪这群用户，看看其中有多少百分比在四周后仍在使用该产品，这是一个很好的例子，说明如何跟踪保留率。

And then we talk about monetization, which is, "How much net new revenue  did I make this week versus last week?" Okay.

然后我们谈到货币化，也就是，“我这周和上周相比净增了多少收入？”好吧。

And then you apply your own  custom business funnel to this.

然后您将自己的自定义业务漏斗应用于此。

So if you're Netflix, we're all familiar that users sign  up for Netflix.

所以如果你是Netflix，我们都知道用户注册Netflix。

Then they play videos in a loop.

然后他们循环播放视频。

Netflix is obviously very sticky,  watching it a lot.

Netflix显然很粘人，经常看它。

And then finally when the trial runs out, you do subscription  upgraded, and you get access to more content.

最后，当试用结束时，您进行订阅升级，您可以访问更多内容。

Okay.

好吧。

So how do you collect data  once you have this funnel? So there's analytics APIs out there.

那么，一旦你有了这个漏斗，你如何收集数据呢？所以现在有了分析API。

I'm using Segment as  an example.

我使用Segment作为示例。

You basically want to say user one, two, three in this case has  done user sign up event, and they happen to be an organic user, which means  they're not invited by someone else.

你基本上想说用户一，二，三在这种情况下已经完成了用户注册活动，他们碰巧是一个有机用户，这意味着他们没有被其他人邀请。

Then if you're Netflix, you might say the users  video played, and eventually subscription upgraded.

然后，如果你是Netflix，你可能会说用户播放了视频，并最终升级了订阅。

And so this is how you instrument your tracking  in your mobile app or your or your web app.

这就是你如何在你的移动应用程序或网络应用程序中进行跟踪。

Then you think about event  properties.

然后考虑事件属性。

So imagine you're Netflix and you're holding one of these video played events in  your hands.

假设你是Netflix，你手里拿着这些视频播放的事件之一。

And you're wondering questions about it.

你想知道关于它的问题。

So what video is the user actually  playing? How long is the video? How far did the person get inside of the  video? Right? Equivalently if you're holding a subscription upgraded event, you're going to want to  derive monetization as a north star metric.

那么用户实际播放的是什么视频呢？视频有多长？那个人在视频里走了多远？对吗？同样，如果您正在举行订阅升级事件，您将希望获得作为北极星指标的货币化。

So if you're a subscription business, you want  to send your monthly recurring revenue.

因此，如果你是一家订阅企业，你想要发送你的每月经常性收入。

If you're a transactional business like e-commerce or retail,  you want to send the actual value of the transaction.

如果您是电子商务或零售等事务性业务，则需要发送交易的实际价值。

Okay.

好吧。

So then you push  this out into your web app, your mobile app.

然后你把这个推送到你的网络应用程序，你的移动应用程序中。

Then you start seeing the data  come in.

然后你开始看到数据进来。

You look at the debugger.

您可以查看调试器。

You see, "Okay, user signup is here.

你看，“好的，用户注册在这里。

Everything  looks good." You add your first analytics tool.

一切看起来都很好。“你添加了你的第一个分析工具。

We'll use Amplitude as a good example  here.

我们将使用振幅作为一个很好的例子。

Amplitude and Mixpanel are pretty awesome analytics tools out in the market right now.

振幅和混合面板是目前市场上非常棒的分析工具。

 And then you start seeing data flow inside of one of these analytics tools.

然后你开始在这些分析工具中看到数据流。

So  this is Amplitude.

这就是振幅。

You can start seeing user signups growing as soon as you launched  the real mobile or web app.

一旦你启动了真正的移动或网络应用程序，你就可以开始看到用户注册人数的增长。

Okay.

好吧。

So now that you have analytics set up,  it's them to focus on three different metrics.

现在你已经建立了分析，他们应该关注三个不同的指标。

The first one is the acquisition metric,  signups per week.

第一个是收购指标，每周注册人数。

It's really nice if you're a B2B business to cut this by  the invite type.

如果你是一家B2B企业，通过邀请类型来削减它，这真的很好。

So you have organic users which are just signing up from coming  to your website, direct signup.

所以你有机的用户，他们刚刚从来到你的网站，直接注册。

And then some users are inviting other users.

然后一些用户邀请其他用户。

So those  are invite type, right? So when you're thinking about growth, it's really important to think  about the organic user in that case, right? Another example of why event properties are  important.

所以这些都是邀请型的，对吧？所以当你考虑增长的时候，在这种情况下考虑有机用户是非常重要的，对吧？事件属性为何重要的另一个示例。

The way you create this is you go to Amplitude, you say, "Event segmentation  report, user signup.

你创建这个的方式是你去振幅，你说，“事件分段报告，用户注册。

Next." Here's your graph, right? So it's as easy as that.

下一个。“这是你的图表，对吧？所以就这么简单。

Just  website, send data, gets to Amplitude.

只是网站，发送数据，得到振幅。

And then you can see the amount of organic  users every week.

然后你可以看到每周有机用户的数量。

And then if you're working on the acquisition step as a secondary  metric, you can basically say, "Today 218 users organically signed up in the last week.

然后，如果您正在将获取步骤作为次要指标进行处理，您基本上可以说，“今天218个用户在上周有机地注册了。

 But by the end of the month, we want that to be at 300.

但到本月底，我们希望这个数字能达到300。

And  we're going to execute projects A, B, and C this month.

这个月我们将执行项目A，B和C。

And then we're going  to watch this graph every single day on a T.V.

然后我们每天都会在电视上看这个图表。

Dashboard in our office or  our apartment, wherever we work.

我们办公室或公寓中的仪表盘，无论我们在哪里工作。

And then we're going to see if our efforts are  actually driving this," right? So that's an idea of data-driven operation of a team.

然后我们会看看我们的努力是否真的在推动这个，“对吧？这是一个团队的数据驱动运营的想法。

You  set a metric and a goal, and then you drive towards that every day.

你设定了一个指标和一个目标，然后你每天都朝着这个目标前进。

Okay.

好吧。

 The second one is retention cohort.

第二个是保留队列。

So someone recently asked about retention.

所以最近有人问起关于保留的问题。

We'll talk about  that right now.

我们现在就谈这个。

So with retention, you want to think about cohorts of users.

因此，在保留方面，您需要考虑用户群。

So  you want to say Monday to Sunday, let's say December 10 through December 17th, 16  users signed up.

所以你想说周一到周日，比如说12月10日到12月17日，16个用户注册了。

And then you look at those 16 users as they use your  product on a week zero which is their signup week, week one, week two, week  three and a week four.

然后你看看这16个用户，因为他们在零周使用你的产品，这是他们的注册周，第一周，第二周，第三周和第四周。

And the general idea here is you can convince your  mom or your grandma to use your product once.

这里的一般想法是，你可以说服你的妈妈或你的奶奶使用你的产品一次。

But even your mom or your  grandma won't continue to come back and use your product over time every single week,  right? And so if you see users that are addicted, that are coming back week  over week, that's a really good sign of product market fit.

但即使是你的妈妈或奶奶也不会每周都回来使用你的产品，对吗？因此，如果你看到上瘾的用户，他们一周又一周地回来，这是一个非常好的产品市场契合的迹象。

So this business can  see that the December 10th cohort, only 6.25% of those users are still around on  week four.

因此，该公司可以看到，12月10日的队列中，只有6.25%的用户在第四周仍然存在。

And that's a pretty low amount, right? So you probably want that to  be somewhere between 20 or 30 at least.

这是一个相当低的数量，对吧？所以你可能希望它至少在20或30之间。

And so you can set a goal  saying, "I'm going to talk to a bunch of these target users and try to  figure out why they're not getting value out of the product.

所以你可以设定一个目标，说，“我要和一群这些目标用户交谈，试着找出为什么他们没有从产品中获得价值。

And then make some  changes as well." Okay.

然后再做一些改变。“好的。

So what metric do you actually pick? This is taken from  one of Gustav's slides.

那么，您实际选择的指标是什么？这是取自古斯塔夫的一张幻灯片。

Pretty awesome.

真是太棒了。

You think about what value your company is giving  to your users.

你考虑一下你的公司给你的用户带来了什么价值。

So Airbnb gives you value by letting you stay at different rental  properties around the world, right? And they want you to do that at least one  time a year, otherwise they consider you a churned user.

所以Airbnb让你住在世界各地不同的租赁酒店，从而给你带来价值，对吗？他们希望你每年至少这样做一次，否则他们会认为你是一个被搅动的用户。

Equivalently, Facebook gives you value  by letting you look at the newsfeed and connect with your friends.

同样，Facebook通过让你查看新闻提要并与你的朋友联系，给你带来价值。

And they want  you to do that at least daily or monthly once.

他们希望你至少每天或每月做一次。

And so when you think  about product market fit, you basically have these two different curves that happen.

所以当你考虑产品市场适合度时，你基本上有这两种不同的曲线。

So we  have that cohort of 16 users that signed up in one week ,and we track  them over time.

所以我们有16个用户在一周内注册，我们跟踪他们一段时间。

And so what ends up happening is for products that don't have  product market fit, they end up tending to go to zero, because people just don't  care about the product, right? And that's definition of product market fit.

所以最终发生的事情是，对于那些没有产品市场适应性的产品，它们最终趋于零，因为人们根本不关心产品，对吧？这就是产品市场适合度的定义。

For those tools  and the products that do have product market fit, you'll see some kind of natural  plateau.

对于那些确实适合产品市场的工具和产品，你会看到某种自然的高原。

Don't mind this axis.

别介意这个轴。

It should be somewhere between 20 and 30% at least.

至少应该在20%到30%之间。

 Okay.

好吧。

So how do you create this graph? It seems kind of complicated, right? Luckily  both Mixpanel and Amplitude have really awesome reports for this.

那么如何创建这个图形呢？看起来有点复杂，对吧？幸运的是，Mixpanel和Amplity都有非常棒的报告。

So in Amplitude it's a  retention analysis report.

所以在振幅方面，这是一份保留分析报告。

You say, users enter the cohort with the user signup.

您说，用户通过用户注册进入队列。

And then  they returned with the video played or the subscription upgraded event, that's the value event.

然后他们带着播放的视频或订阅升级事件返回，这就是价值事件。

 And then you press Next and out comes this graph.

然后你按下一步，就会出现这个图表。

And then you could look  at four week retention for cohorts, improve the product and watch as new cohorts that  strike the four week mark do better or worse, right? And that shows you whether  your changes week over week or actually improving.

然后你可以查看队列的四周保留时间，改进产品，并观看达到四周标记的新队列的表现更好或更差，对不对？这向你展示了你的改变是一周又一周，还是真正的改善。

Okay.

好吧。

Finally revenue.

终于有收入了。

So this is the  primary metric that you want to be thinking about.

所以这是你想要考虑的主要指标。

You'll use for a subscription business,  the subscription upgraded event.

对于订阅业务，您将使用订阅升级事件。

You'll do a property sum over new plan, monthly recurring revenue.

你将做一个新计划的财产总和，每月的经常性收入。

 You press Next, and outcomes your weekly net new revenue graph.

您按下一步，并产生您的每周净新收入图表。

And then you could  set monthly goals on top of this to make sure you're growing at the rates  that you to be.

然后你可以在此基础上设定每月目标，以确保你正在以你想要的速度增长。

Okay.

好吧。

Finally, if you have a founding team, it's really good  to basically put all this stuff on a dashboard, and then put this dashboard on  a T.V.

最后，如果你有一个创始团队，基本上把所有这些东西放在仪表板上，然后把这个仪表板放在电视上，这真的很好。

In your office.

在你办公室。

It's incredibly, incredibly important.

这是非常重要的。

Basically, this is kind of the  difference between being a data driven team and not a data driven team.

基本上，这就是数据驱动型团队与非数据驱动型团队之间的区别。

A lot  of founders actually set up their analytics, but then don't look at them ever again  because it can be painful, right? While data driven team will put it on a  T.V.

很多创始人实际上建立了他们的分析，但之后再也不看他们了，因为这可能会很痛苦，对吧？而数据驱动团队会把它放到电视上。

And talk about projects, talk about what those projects are actually changing the metrics  that they're trying to drive.

谈论项目，谈论那些项目实际上正在改变他们试图推动的指标。

And then just completely understand the business every single day,  right? And this kind of company and this kind of founder will actually scale to  build better high performance companies, because the next team of employees they hire will also  be looking at that same T.V.

然后每天都完全了解业务，对吗？而这种公司和这种创始人实际上会扩大规模来建立更好的高绩效公司，因为他们雇佣的下一批员工也会关注同样的电视广告。

Dashboard and be driven off those same metrics.

仪表板和被赶出这些相同的指标。

So  really important, get a T.V.

所以真的很重要，去做个电视。

Next what you want to do is have some kind  of social accountability around your metrics.

下一步你想做的是在你的指标周围建立某种社会责任。

So if you have your friends, your parents, your  advisors, your investors package up how your business is doing into an email.

因此，如果你有你的朋友，你的父母，你的顾问，你的投资者把你的生意如何打包成一封电子邮件。

This helps  you synthesize what is actually happening.

这有助于你合成实际正在发生的事情。

And then send it out to those advisors and  tell them where the business is struggling, and what your plan is to fix it.

然后把它发给那些顾问，告诉他们业务在哪里苦苦挣扎，以及你的计划是什么来解决它。

 This allows the advisors to quickly understand the business, and then respond back with a  much more appropriate advice.

这使得顾问能够快速了解业务，然后以更合适的建议作为回应。

Cool.

很好。

And now we'll go into the startup stack.

现在我们将进入启动堆栈。

So these  are tools that we recommend that help this kind of tactical process of setting up  these metrics.

因此，我们建议使用这些工具来帮助设置这些指标的这种战术过程。

So I'm going to talk a little bit about that MVP business workflow  that Michael talked about earlier.

因此，我将略微谈一谈Michael之前提到的MVP业务工作流程。

So initially you're building an MVP segment.

因此，最初您正在构建一个MVP细分市场。

Built about seven  different MVPs before we actually found Segment.

在我们真正找到Segment之前，我们构建了大约七个不同的MVP。

And all of those failed.

所有这些都失败了。

And eventually we  found one that worked.

最终我们找到了一个有用的。

And the process of actually building the MVP is incredibly important.

而实际构建MVP的过程是极其重要的。

 So once you have that little experiment built, you want to enter private beta.

所以一旦你建立了这个小实验，你就想进入私人测试版。

Which  basically just means getting 10, 20, 30 customers to actually try this product, and then  having very direct lines of communication open with them.

这基本上意味着让10，20，30个客户实际试用这个产品，然后与他们建立非常直接的沟通渠道。

What Segment does nowadays, every new  product we ship, we open Slack channels with each one of our customers.

如今，我们所做的每一件新产品，我们都会与我们的每一位客户打开松弛的渠道。

And we  have the product managers sit in those Slack channels and talk with the customers.

我们让产品经理坐在那些松弛的频道里，与客户交谈。

For  the products that don't get product market fit, the customers just stop responding and we're  asking, asking, asking and they're not responding, right? And for the products that do have  product market fit, the customers are immediately being like, "Oh, why don't you have this  feature? This is broken.

对于不适合产品市场的产品，客户只是停止响应，而我们一直在问，他们没有响应，对吗？而对于那些确实符合市场需求的产品，客户马上就会说，“哦，为什么你没有这个功能？这个坏了。

I tried inviting my team.

我试着邀请我的团队。

Man, this is not working." So  instead of you kind of pulling out the customer, the customer starts pulling at you.

伙计，这是行不通的。“所以你不是把客户拉出来，而是客户开始拉你。

 That's a good feeling of product market fit.

这是一种很好的产品市场契合感。

Okay.

好吧。

So at some point the private  beta is going well.

所以在某种程度上，私人测试版进行得很好。

You feel like people really care about this.

你觉得人们真的很关心这件事。

You understand your  target customer.

你了解你的目标客户。

Then you want to get a larger market segment to use it.

然后，您希望获得更大的市场细分来使用它。

That's  the launch that we talked about earlier.

这就是我们之前谈到的发射。

Try to get there as quickly as possible.

尽量尽快赶到那里。

 And then a launch is just more users that you get to test product market  fit on.

然后发布只是更多的用户，你可以测试产品市场的适合性。

And so if you feel product market fit there, then you can start  scaling the company, right? And you hire sales people and you start doing paid marketing  and things like that.

因此，如果你觉得那里的产品市场合适，那么你就可以开始扩大公司规模了，对吧？然后你雇佣销售人员，你开始做付费营销之类的事情。

So different tools will guide you throughout this process.

因此，不同的工具将在整个过程中指导您。

So as  you're building an MVP and you're about to give it to the first group of  customers, install Google Analytics, install Amplitude.

因此，当您正在构建MVP并准备将其提供给第一组客户时，请安装Google Analytics，安装Amplity。

Google Analytics will tell you who's coming from the  internet to your website.

谷歌分析将告诉你谁从互联网来到你的网站。

And then Amplitude will tell you which features are they using,  how engaged are they with that feature set.

然后振幅会告诉你他们正在使用哪些特征，他们与该特征集的参与程度。

Unless you're able to stand over the  shoulders of all of your users a 100% of the time, Analytics is the next  best alternative for that.

除非你能够100%地站在所有用户的肩膀上，否则Analytics是下一个最好的选择。

We also install live chat on the page.

我们还在页面上安装了即时聊天。

So either Slack  with your customers.

所以要么和你的客户松弛。

Or if you can't do that then maybe have a live chat  available.

或者，如果你不能这样做，那么可能有一个实时聊天可用。

In the beginning of Segment, customers would ping us day and night.

在Segment开始时，客户会昼夜不停地向我们发出ping信号。

And that's  where we got the most valuable feedback from them.

这就是我们从他们那里得到的最有价值的反馈。

So just as many open channels  of communication as possible.

所以尽可能多的开放沟通渠道。

Next, data warehouse.

接下来是数据仓库。

This is something that we recommend.

这是我们推荐的东西。

It used  to be expensive.

以前很贵。

It's no longer expensive today.

今天不再贵了。

Basically if you have a non-technical co-founder  on your team, they'll want to ask questions around the data.

基本上，如果你的团队中有一个非技术的联合创始人，他们会想要问关于数据的问题。

And they'll always ask  the technical co-founder who will have to provide the answers.

而且他们总是会问技术联合创始人谁将不得不提供答案。

So a data warehouse kind  of democratizes the data, not only for the non-technical co-founders, but for everyone else in  the company that you hire after.

因此，数据仓库在某种程度上使数据大众化，不仅对于非技术性的联合创始人，而且对于您之后雇用的公司中的其他所有人都是如此。

Company dashboards, obviously I should probably move that to  the left.

公司仪表盘，显然我应该把它移到左边。

Email and push tools.

电子邮件和推送工具。

So as soon as users sign up, you want  to send them an email.

所以一旦用户注册，你就想给他们发送一封电子邮件。

I'll talk about that in a second.

我一会儿再谈这个。

And then a  help desk.

然后是服务台。

So at some point you'll have so much support tickets if you start  feeling product market fit.

因此，在某个时候，如果你开始觉得产品市场适合，你会有很多支持票。

And if they're all going to your Gmail, one founder will  just get overwhelmed and not be able to answer them.

如果他们都去了你的Gmail，一个创始人就会不知所措，无法回复他们。

So you want to have  a shared inbox where multiple founders can respond.

所以你希望有一个共享的收件箱，让多个创始人可以回应。

Okay.

好吧。

Now I'm going to go through  a few different recipes of these different tools that we found really helpful in product  market fit.

现在，我将通过这些不同工具的几个不同的食谱，我们发现它们对产品市场非常有帮助。

So the first one is improving product usability.

所以第一个就是提高产品的可用性。

Almost every product that's launched  is unusable or highly unusable for the first three months while you have the kinks.

几乎所有发布的产品在头三个月都无法使用或高度不可用，而你却有这些问题。

 And we see this with every single product, no matter how much effort we put  into it ahead of time.

我们在每一个产品上都看到了这一点，无论我们提前投入了多少努力。

As soon as customers hit it, they start using it  in ways that you just don't expect.

一旦客户点击它，他们就开始以你不期望的方式使用它。

And so there's this tool called Fullstory, which  helps you look at sessions of customers as they use your website.

所以有一个叫做FullStory的工具，它可以帮助你在客户使用你的网站时查看他们的会话。

So I'll tell  a quick story on this.

所以我会讲一个简短的故事。

This is a new feature in Personas, which is one  of Segment's products.

这是Segment的产品之一Persona中的一项新功能。

And we launched then, the metrics looked horrible.

然后我们发布了，指标看起来很糟糕。

So customers were coming  in, but they weren't actually completing it.

所以顾客来了，但他们并没有真正完成它。

They weren't using the product and we thought,  "Oh, God.

他们没有使用产品，我们想，“哦，天哪。

This likely doesn't have product market fit.

这可能没有产品市场适合。

We have to go back to  the drawing board." Then one of the designers in our team had this amazing idea,  "Let's look at the full story." And so we see this user going in about  to start this creation workflow.

我们必须回到绘图板。“然后我们团队中的一位设计师有了一个令人惊奇的想法，”让我们看看整个故事。“所以我们看到这个用户即将开始这个创建工作流程。

They find this button.

他们找到了这个按钮。

They clearly don't understand what the  button does.

他们显然不明白按钮的作用。

They get so frustrated they just exit the page.

他们非常沮丧，他们只是退出页面。

And so we saw  this with multiple different customers coming in.

所以我们看到有很多不同的客户进来。

And so we're like, "Okay, we just have  to fix that button." We fixed that button, immediately all the metrics got better.
