# Dalton Caldwell - All About Pivoting

Dalton Caldwell:How's everybody doing? I'm Dalton.

道尔顿·考德威尔：大家好吗？我是道尔顿。

I'm a partner at Y Combinator.

我是Y Combinator的合伙人。

In addition, I'm the  Head of Admissions, which is our selection process for the companies that get into YC.

此外，我是招生主管，这是我们对进入YC的公司的选择过程。

 I'm here to talk about pivoting.

我是来谈转轴的。

Yeah, let's talk all about pivoting.

是啊，我们来谈谈转轴的事吧。

Cool.

很好。

All right.

好的。

 Here's some stuff we're going to cover.

这里有一些我们要讨论的内容。

What the heck is a pivot, why you  should pivot, when you should pivot, and evaluating ideas to pivot to.

到底什么是枢轴，你为什么应该枢轴，什么时候应该枢轴，以及评估要枢轴的想法。

So we're going  to try to cover all the bases here, all right? Let's talk about the term  pivot.

所以我们要试着覆盖这里的所有基地，好吗？让我们来谈谈枢轴这个术语。

This is one of those terms that if I'm in a cafe and I  hear someone talking about pivoting, I roll my eyes because it was one of those  words that I associate with annoying startup people.

这是其中一个术语，如果我在咖啡馆里听到有人谈论旋转，我会翻白眼，因为这是我与恼人的初创公司人联系在一起的一个词。

And so let's just explain what we  mean here.

所以让我们解释一下我们在这里的意思。

It just means changing your idea.

这只是意味着改变你的想法。

That's all it means.

这就是它的意思。

And technically, if  we want to be really technical, I would call a true pivot where it's like  a real company and you have lots of users and you've raised money and you're  like, "We're going to shut this thing down and do something different." So the most  famous example is Slack.

从技术上讲，如果我们想要真正的技术性，我会称之为真正的支点，它就像一个真正的公司，你有很多用户，你已经筹集了资金，你会说，“我们要关闭这个东西，做一些不同的事情。”所以最著名的例子就是松弛。

They raised money and had like a hundred employees for this  video game called Glitch.

他们筹集了资金，并为这款名为“小故障”的视频游戏雇佣了大约100名员工。

I was a beta user and then one day they just  shut it down and like did something crazy.

我是一个beta用户，然后有一天他们就把它关闭了，就像做了一些疯狂的事情。

I would call that a pivot.

我会称之为支点。

I  think that's a valid use of it.

我认为这是一个有效的使用它。

Probably what most of the folks here are  doing, I interchangeably call it pivoting, but you should just call it changing your idea.

也许这里的大多数人都在做，我可以互换地称之为旋转，但你应该称它为改变你的想法。

 It should feel really lightweight.

它应该感觉真的很轻。

When you're at the earliest stages of your company, especially  prelaunch or very near after launch, changing your ideas constantly is kind of the norm  and I wouldn't think that this is some huge thing.

当你处于公司的早期阶段，特别是在发射前或发射之后，不断改变你的想法是一种规范，我不认为这是什么大事。

It should feel lightweight and  frankly if you're not in a state where you're rapidly changing ideas or assumptions over  and over and over again in quick succession, you are likely doing it wrong.

它应该感觉轻便，坦率地说，如果你没有处于一次又一次快速连续快速改变想法或假设的状态，那么你很可能做错了。

You  are likely moving too slow.

你可能动作太慢了。

And so this is just like part of it, change  your idea constantly, trying to find exactly the right version of your idea is something  you should be doing in the beginning.

所以这就像是其中的一部分，不断地改变你的想法，试图找到你想法的正确版本，这是你应该在一开始就做的事情。

Let's talk about why you should pivot.

让我们谈谈为什么你应该转向。

So  the main reason I would argue is opportunity cost and the definition of opportunity cost  is the loss of potential gain from other alternatives where one alternative is chosen.

所以我会争论的主要原因是机会成本，而机会成本的定义是，在选择一种选择的情况下，从其他选择中获得的潜在收益的损失。

So  in other words, you can only really work on one thing at a time.

所以换句话说，你一次只能做一件事。

Sometimes  people try to violate that rule, but that's a whole different topic.

有时人们试图违反这条规则，但那是一个完全不同的话题。

And so by  working on something that's not working and you have evidence that it's not working, you  are taking opportunity costs to not be doing something else.

因此，通过做一些不起作用的事情，你有证据证明它不起作用，你就是在承担机会成本，不去做其他事情。

It's as simple as that.

就这么简单。

 Right? I don't know.

对吗？我不知道。

I tried to write some pseudo-code here for you about, it's  a kind of a joke, but like how all things are working divided by the  number of months of concerted fulltime effort.

我试着在这里为你写一些伪代码，这是一种笑话，但就像所有事情是如何工作的除以协调的全职工作的月数。

If that number is less than excitement to  work on something else plus confidence you can find something better, you should pivot.

如果这个数字不足以让你对从事其他工作感到兴奋，再加上你有信心找到更好的东西，那么你应该转向。

And  so the key thing to, if you look at this equation, like what am I  really trying to say, it's that if you've worked on something for months and months  and months and months and it's not happening, that's a pretty good signal, right? That's  what drives this equation that I put here the most is the number of months  you worked on something and it's not working.

所以关键的一点是，如果你看这个方程，比如我真正想说的是，如果你花了几个月、几个月的时间在做某件事，但它没有发生，这是一个很好的信号，对吧？这就是驱动这个等式的原因，我在这里放的最多的是你在某件事情上工作的月数，它不起作用。

And so if you're throwing good money  after bad, good time after bad and it's not happening for you, that is a  pretty darn good signal.

所以如果你一次又一次地投入好钱，一次又一次的糟糕，而这并没有发生在你身上，这是一个非常好的信号。

But if it's really, really, really early and you've only been  working on something a couple of weeks, it's less obvious.

但如果真的很早，而且你只做了几个星期的事情，那就不那么明显了。

Let's give you some good  reasons to pivot.

让我们给你一些很好的理由让你转向。

I hate working on it.

我讨厌在上面工作。

All right.

好的。

It's not growing.

它没有成长。

It's just  not working.

只是不起作用。

I keep doing the thing and nothing is happening.

我一直在做这件事，但什么都没有发生。

I'm not a good  fit to be working on this idea, like the more you learn about this, the  more you realize that you are just not the right person for the idea.

我不适合从事这个想法，就像你对这个了解得越多，你就越意识到你不是这个想法的合适人选。

Another  one is I'm relying on an external factor outside of my control to make my  startup take off.

另一个原因是我依赖于一个我无法控制的外部因素来让我的创业公司腾飞。

So a couple of examples of that are like relying on mainstream  virtual reality headset adoption.

所以有几个例子就像是依赖于主流虚拟现实头盔的采用。

That's a good one.

这是一个很好的。

You know, like, "Any day now the  new Facebook thing's going to take off and that's when my VR app's going to  take off." Or like relying on mainstream crypto adoption, things like that.

你知道，就像，“现在任何一天，Facebook的新东西都会起飞，我的VR应用程序就会起飞。”或者像依赖主流密码的采用，诸如此类的事情。

Those are totally  out of your control and if you're just sitting here hoping someone else does something  good and then your startup will work, man, you should definitely pivot.

这些都完全超出了你的控制范围，如果你只是坐在这里希望别人做些好事，然后你的初创公司就会成功，伙计，你绝对应该转向。

Another one is  just where you're out of ideas on how to make the thing work.

另一个就是你对如何使这件事工作没有想法。

You've thrown  everything against the wall to make your current idea work and you're actually kind of  out of ideas.

你把所有的东西都扔到墙上去让你现在的想法发挥作用，而你实际上已经没有想法了。

That's usually a sign you should pivot.

这通常是你应该转向的标志。

Good reasons to not pivot.

不转向的好理由。

 You're trying to run away from doing hard work.

你想逃避繁重的工作。

Sometimes you see people where they  build a product and right when it gets to sales time, they pivot and they  do that over and over again.

有时你会看到人们在制造产品的时候，一旦到了销售时间，他们就会转过来，一遍又一遍地做这件事。

That's probably not a good reason to pivot, it's  just someone trying to dodge the sales part.

这可能不是一个转向的好理由，只是有人试图回避销售部分。

So watch out for that.

所以当心这一点。

Also another  reason not to pivot is if you're the type of person that changes their idea  over and over and over and over again, like chronically, and you're detecting yourself doing  that.

另一个不转向的原因是，如果你是那种会一次又一次地改变他们想法的人，就像是慢性的，并且你正在发现自己在这样做。

It's good to actually follow something through all the way, so you just want  to watch out for that happening.

这是很好的，实际上跟随某事通过所有的方式，所以你只是想要留心这种情况的发生。

Also, a good reason not to pivot is that  you just hear there's some hot new thing and you want to pivot because you  read a TechCrunch article because someone raised money for a hot new thing.

另外，不转向的一个很好的理由是，你刚刚听说有一些热门的新事物，你想转向是因为你读了一篇TechCrunch的文章，因为有人为一个热门的新事物筹集了资金。

That's not  a great reason to pivot.

这不是一个转向的好理由。

Let me give you some reasons on why people take  too long to pivot and the reason I mention this is I would argue on  average, most people take too long to pivot, right? I think that's usually ...

让我给你一些原因，为什么人们需要太长的时间来转向，我提到这一点的原因是，我认为，平均而言，大多数人需要太长的时间来转向，对吗？我想那通常是.。

Like  if I had to put people in buckets, more people take too long than the  reverse.

就像我必须把人放进桶里一样，更多的人花的时间太长了，反之亦然。

And so why do they take too long? Loss aversion, when you feel like  you've invested in something, you have a really hard time letting go of it, and  that's loss aversion.

那么为什么他们花的时间太长了呢？损失厌恶，当你觉得你已经投资了什么东西，你真的很难放弃它，这就是损失厌恶。

You can research this.

你可以研究这个。

Have a little bit of traction, like you  have a few users or one customer, you're like, "Maybe it'll work." That will make  you not pivot and that's rough.

有一点牵引力，就像你有几个用户或一个客户，你会说，“也许它会起作用。”这会让你不会转向，这很粗糙。

Another thing is like people are very polite in  the world and they have a hard time telling you the truth that they don't  like the thing that you're working on.

另一件事是，人们在这个世界上非常有礼貌，他们很难告诉你真相，他们不喜欢你正在做的事情。

And so a lot of founders get confused  about politeness and getting that confused with traction.

因此，许多创始人对礼貌感到困惑，并将其与牵引力混淆。

And so you're never going to really,  I mean maybe, I shouldn't say never, most likely you're not going to have people  being like, "Your idea is horrible, give up now.

所以你永远不会真的，我的意思是也许，我不应该说永远，很可能你不会让人们说，“你的想法太可怕了，现在就放弃吧。”

I will never be a customer."  They're not going to tell you that to your face, be like, "Oh this is  great.

我永远不会成为顾客。“他们不会当着你的面告诉你，就像，”哦，这太棒了。

Maybe if you add few more features and come back we'll take a look  at it." Right? Oh that's dangerous, because you can end up doing that iteratively over  and over and over again for like years and never actually get customers.

也许如果你再添加几个功能，然后回来，我们会看看它。“对吧？哦，这很危险，因为你可能会一次又一次地重复这样做很多年，却永远得不到真正的客户。

So watch  out for politeness and getting politeness confused with traction.

所以要小心礼貌，把礼貌和牵引力搞混了。

Another one is fear of admitting  weakness or defeat.

另一种是害怕承认软弱或失败。

If you pivot, you're giving up in some way.

如果你转向，你就在某种程度上放弃了。

Another one is  putting blame on why things aren't working on customers or investors.

另一种是将责任归咎于客户或投资者不能正常工作的原因。

So this is where  you're like, "I'm not wrong.

所以这就是你说的，“我没有错。

The world is wrong.

这个世界是错的。

No one gets this.

没人明白这个。

This is  way ahead of its time." Things like that are not a great sign, and usually  people realize that maybe it is kind of on them versus on the external world,  but it takes a long time to get there.

这是一个超前的时代。“这样的事情并不是一个好的征兆，通常人们会意识到，也许这是在他们身上，而不是在外部世界，但要花很长时间才能到达那里。

And then finally there's a lot  of inspirational stuff out there that's just like if you just believe hard enough and  keep going, you'll eventually be recognized and everything will be great.

最后，还有很多鼓舞人心的东西，就像如果你足够努力地相信并坚持下去，你最终会被认可，一切都会变得很棒的。

And so there's a  lot of those inspirational messages out there and that can kind of be counterproductive.

所以有很多鼓舞人心的信息，这可能会适得其反。

I  don't know if this is super legible, but basically this is where I talk about  a little bit of traction thing.

我不知道这是不是超级清晰，但基本上这就是我谈论一点牵引力的地方。

I call it the Uncanny Valley of product market  fit.

我称之为产品市场契合度的离奇谷。

And you know what's weird, I noticed this as a YC partner, someone that  gets into YC with a idea that's just a total fail, like immediately, is actually  at a huge advantage than someone that has a little bit of traction.

你知道奇怪的是，作为YC的合作伙伴，我注意到了这一点，一个带着完全失败的想法进入YC的人，就像立即，实际上比那些有一点牵引力的人有很大的优势。

Isn't that  weird? Like a total fail, the founders can declare bankruptcy on the idea immediately and  just work on other stuff with no regrets and no second guessing, "Oh, should I  pivot?" They're like, "Wow, that was really bad," and having that freedom to immediately throw  off the old idea and work on a new one is actually a weird advantage.

是不是很奇怪？就像彻底失败一样，创始人可以立即宣布这个想法破产，然后无怨无悔地做其他事情，没有第二次猜测，“哦，我应该转向吗？”他们会说，“哇，那真的很糟糕，”而拥有那种立即抛弃旧想法并研究新想法的自由，实际上是一个奇怪的优势。

 Isn't that counterintuitive? And so you just want to really watch out for a little  bit of traction because I've seen that be a trap that capture a lot of  really talented people for long periods of time.

这不是违反直觉的吗？所以你只需要留心一点牵引力，因为我已经看到了这是一个陷阱，在很长一段时间里捕获了很多真正有才华的人。

And then let's just talk about the  anecdotes.

然后我们就谈谈那些轶事吧。

So anecdotes about stories of people that just kept doing what they were doing  and it didn't work, and then five years later, it was great.

所以，关于人们一直在做他们正在做的事情的轶事并没有奏效，然后五年后，这是伟大的。

I think those  are cool and they're inspirational and I like them and they're all true, they're anecdotes.

我认为这些都很酷，它们很有启发性，我喜欢它们，它们都是真的，它们是轶事。

 But it's kind of like anecdotes about people that play the lottery every day for  five years and then they won the lottery and now they're really happy and that's  super cool, but that is not actionable for you, right? There's nothing you can do  with this anecdote about someone that just kept believing strong enough.

但这有点像是关于人们连续五年每天都在玩彩票的轶事，然后他们中了彩票，现在他们真的很开心，这非常酷，但这对你来说是不可行的，不是吗？关于一个一直坚信足够强大的人的轶事，你是无能为力的。

I would much rather  give people advice to play the statistics of this and to take accountability for their  own actions in the world than just hope and dream that you might be one  of the anecdotes too.

我更愿意给人们建议玩这个统计数字，并为他们自己在世界上的行为承担责任，而不是仅仅希望和梦想你也可能成为其中的一个奇闻轶事。

And so if you decide to pivot or don't decide to  pivot, just remember you decide.

因此，如果你决定转向或不决定转向，只要记住你的决定。

It's your life, and if it works out good or  bad, that's on you.

这是你的生活，不管是好是坏，都是你的错。

And so often I get founders that want to push this  decision on me as a YC partner or other authority figures about, "Is this idea  of working or not? When should I know when to give up?" And ultimately all  we can do is give you guidance.

而且经常有创始人想把这个决定强加给我，作为YC合伙人或其他权威人士，“这个想法是工作还是不工作？我什么时候应该知道什么时候放弃呢？最终我们能做的就是给你指引。

But this is exactly in the class of  problems that is on the founder and never something you should look to an authority  figure to tell you how to decide.

但这恰恰是创始人的问题，你永远不应该指望权威人物告诉你如何做出决定。

Product market fit.

产品市场适合。

I'm sure, you know, we're  talking about this a lot, it's been discussed a lot in startup school and it's  because it is so important.

我相信，你知道，我们谈论了很多这个问题，在创业学校已经讨论了很多，这是因为它太重要了。

Most people will never get it.

大多数人永远不会明白。

Probably most people watching  this don't have it even if they think they do, and you know you have  it when growth is not your biggest problem, it's other stuff.

可能大多数人看这个节目的时候都没有，即使他们认为他们有，而且你知道，当增长不是你最大的问题时，你有它，它是其他的东西。

And one good reason  to pivot is you just get more shots on goal to try to get this  elusive thing, right? Like if you made something and you launched it and it's like,  "Meh, not really working," a dang good reason to pivot is you get another roll  of the dice, you get another shot.

而转向的一个很好的理由是你只是在球门上射门更多，试图得到这个难以捉摸的东西，对吗？比如，如果你做了一些东西，你发射了它，它就像，“Meh，不是真的工作”，一个他妈的很好的理由来转向，你得到了另一个骰子，你得到了另一个机会。

And so I've just seen people that use  these opportunities really well.

所以我看到人们很好地利用了这些机会。

It's much easier to be lucky when you get half a  dozen shots on goal than one, right? And so if we're just playing the statistics  of how do I get product market fit, taking several high quality shots, notice I  say high quality, you can't just constantly pivot through stuff and then launch it, but  if you do a full awesome product iteration of making something, completing it, shipping it,  giving it to people, following all the advice you're looking here, and you can give  yourself multiple of those shots, I would argue you are creating luck for yourself and  the odds that you actually hit something that works are much higher than someone that  only ever takes one shot.

当你在球门上射门六次比一次更容易幸运，对吧？所以如果我们只是在统计我如何让产品适合市场，拍了几张高质量的照片，注意我说的高质量，你不能不断地通过一些东西旋转，然后发布它，但是如果你做了一个完整的很棒的产品迭代，制作，完成它，运输它，把它给人们，遵循所有你在这里寻找的建议，你可以给自己多次这样的注射，我会说你在为自己创造运气，你真的击中了一些有用的东西的几率要比那些只打一针的人要高得多。

Okay, let's talk about how to find a better idea.

好的，让我们谈谈如何找到一个更好的主意。

 Here's the advice that I give people during the batch when they are looking for  an idea to pivot to.

这是我在批处理过程中给人们的建议，当他们正在寻找一个想法时。

Find something that you're more excited about and that makes  you more optimistic about the world and just generally more excited to wake up in  the morning and work on the thing and not less excited.

找到一些让你更兴奋的事情，让你对这个世界更加乐观，并且在早上醒来时更兴奋地去做这件事，而不是降低你的兴奋程度。

And there's a corollary  here and this, I think, is counterintuitive.

这里有一个推论，我认为，这是违反直觉的。

Often choosing what is perceived as a harder  idea, is good.

经常选择被认为是较难的想法是好的。

And so I see a lot of people where they're like working  on some ad network ad tech thing to affiliate something ad targeting, I don't know,  those never work and it's because they're not inspirational and no one cares.

所以我看到很多人，他们喜欢做一些广告网络的广告技术来联合一些有针对性的广告，我不知道，这些从来都不起作用，因为他们没有灵感，没有人关心。

And so  when you see people go from that into something that's really, really exciting, right, like,  "Oh, I want to help small business owners do X," or I had a company  in this last batch and they started with this ad tech thing that they were  all very bored with and they pivoted to Robin Hood for India, and the moment  they pivoted to that, the founders lit up and every conversation I had with them,  they were like so excited about their idea and it was contagious talking to them.

所以当你看到人们从这个转变为真正令人兴奋的事情时，就像，“哦，我想帮助小企业主做X，”或者我在最后一批中有一家公司，他们开始做广告技术的事情，他们都非常厌烦，他们转向印度的罗宾汉，当他们转向这个的那一刻，创始人们点亮了，我和他们的每一次对话，他们对他们的想法感到非常兴奋，和他们交谈是很有感染力的。

 And it was almost like a different ...

几乎就像是一个不同的.。

Like the amount of change, it was  the same founders, but what changed is they found an idea that was real, that  they were excited about, and not just some like boring ad tech crap.

就像改变的数量一样，它是相同的创始人，但改变的是他们发现了一个真实的想法，他们对此感到兴奋，而不仅仅是一些无聊的广告技术垃圾。

No one  cares about that stuff.

没人关心那些东西。

Okay.

好吧。

So if you're doing something that seems like a good  startup idea because you read in TechCrunch people raise money for it, but it's not  inspiring to you and you're like, "Man, this is pretty lame," you probably want to  find something that's more exciting to you.

所以，如果你在TechCrunch上读到有人为此筹集资金，所以你正在做一件看起来是个好主意的事情，但这对你来说并不鼓舞，你会说，“伙计，这太逊了”，你可能想找到对你更令人兴奋的东西。

Another thing to do on finding a better  idea is make an honest assessment of what you're good and bad at.

找到更好的主意的另一件事是诚实地评估你的长处和不好之处。

This is  hard, but you want to be really self aware of what you're good and bad  at and play to those strengths.

这很难，但你想要真正自我意识到你的长处和劣势，并发挥这些优势。

And another thing here for finding a good idea,  especially if it's a pivot, find something that you can very quickly build and validate  and not something that takes like a year or two of R&D.

在这里找到一个好主意的另一件事，特别是如果它是一个支点，找到一些你可以非常迅速地建立和验证的东西，而不是像一年或两年的研发那样的东西。

If you pivot  from one thing that's impossible to ship into another thing that's impossible to ship, not  good.

如果你从一个不可能运输的东西转向另一个不可能运输的东西，不好。

Ideally you find something that's way easier to ship, like really fast, highly recommended.

理想情况下，你会找到一些更容易发货的东西，比如非常快的，强烈推荐的东西。

 Quick note here, caveat.

在这里快速注明，警告。

It's totally okay to work an idea where you're not going  to raise venture capital.

在你不打算筹集风险资本的地方工作一个想法是完全可以的。

All good.

一切都很好。

Most businesses in the world don't require venture capital.

世界上大多数企业都不需要风险资本。

 And so if what you're doing is consuming lots of content on how to start  a company like this and it's all kind of like venture capital focused stuff and  you're not going to do something that raises venture capital, you can kind of get  blown off course idea wise.

因此，如果你正在做的是消耗大量关于如何创建这样一家公司的内容，这就像是风险资本集中的东西，而你不打算去做一些筹集风险资本的事情，你可能会被吹到偏离轨道的想法上，明智的做法。

And so just be self aware about this and realize  that if you do want to raise venture capital, the idea does matter a lot  and there's a constant recurring theme I see is people that are trying to raise  money for something that is definitely not venture capital fundable and they get really frustrated.

所以请自己意识到这一点，并意识到如果你真的想要筹集风险资本，这个想法确实很重要，而且我看到的一个不断重复的主题是，人们试图为绝对不能获得风险投资的东西筹集资金，他们真的感到很挫败。

 Everyone gets frustrated with that.

每个人都会对此感到沮丧。

It doesn't make sense for all businesses, and so just  be self aware of this when you're choosing an idea of like, is this something  that at least hypothetically is VC fundable? Just to give you some rule of thumb,  well what does that mean? I don't think there's a guidebook for what venture scale  means, but here's some rules of thumb.

这并不是对所有的企业都有意义，所以当你选择这样的想法时，要自我意识到这一点，这是不是至少假设VC是可以资助的？只是给你一些经验法则，那是什么意思？我不认为有一本关于风险规模意味着什么的指南，但这里有一些经验法则。

Can I imagine this business generating hundreds of  millions or billions in net revenue per year? All right, that sounds venture capital fundable.

我能想象这项业务每年产生数亿或数十亿的净收入吗？好吧，听起来风险资本是可以投资的。

 Can I imagine the revenue growth to get to those numbers to happen in less  than 10 years or five years? Can this happen really fast? Can I imagine this  thing that I'm doing is a publicly traded company someday? Can I picture it? Can  I visualize it? Kevin's first lecture talks about this but these are all things like  if you just can't see any of these, that's not a great sign.

我能想象在不到10年或5年内达到这些数字的收入增长吗？这能很快发生吗？我能想象我正在做的这件事有一天是一家上市公司吗？我能想象吗？我能想象吗？凯文的第一堂课谈到了这一点，但这些都是，如果你看不到这些，这不是一个很好的迹象。

And other  key properties is usually technology is a key component and usually the founders build the  technology at least in the early days for something to be VC fundable.

其他关键属性通常是技术是一个关键组件，通常创始人构建技术，至少在早期是为了获得VC的资助。

You want  to see really high margins, not for everything, but again, just a rule of thumb.

你想看到真正的高利润率，不是所有的东西，但再次，只是一个经验法则。

 Software margins, you know 80% gross margins, 70% gross margins, really high margins that some  of you want to see.

软件利润率，你知道80%的毛利率，70%的毛利率，你们中的一些人想看到的非常高的利润率。

And then, it's funny, I think a lot of people  learn about fundraising from Shark Tank and I don't think a lot of that stuff  is venture fundable just in case you were wondering.

然后，有趣的是，我认为很多人都是从鲨鱼坦克那里学习筹款的，我不认为很多这样的东西是可以风险投资的，以防你想知道。

It's fundable for people that want  to put product stuff together, but I think you'd have a hard time raising money  from venture capitalists for the majority of that stuff.

对于那些想要把产品材料放在一起的人来说，这是可以资助的，但我认为你很难从风险投资家那里筹集到大部分这些东西的资金。

But hey, like I said earlier,  it's your call, it's your dream, so figure it out.

但是，嘿，就像我之前说的，这是你的决定，这是你的梦想，所以想想办法。

When's the best time to  pivot? As soon as these things happen.

什么时候是转向的最佳时机？一旦这些事情发生。

You've launched and trying to get users for  weeks or months and you feel hopeless.

你已经启动并试图获得用户数周或数月，你感到绝望。

It feels hopeless.

感觉没希望了。

You should probably pivot.

你也许应该转向。

When  the idea is impossible to get started with.

当这个想法不可能开始的时候。

Like, "Cool, once we raise $100 million,  then we will build a prototype." You should definitely pivot if you're one of those  people because unless you have $100 million, you are in a chicken and egg unsolvable  issue.

比如，“酷，一旦我们筹集到1亿美元，我们就会建立一个原型。”如果你是这些人中的一员，你绝对应该转向，因为除非你有1亿美元，否则你正处于一个鸡和蛋无法解决的问题中。

And here's another one.

这是另一个。

You know in your heart it's not going to work.

你心里知道这是行不通的。

 A lot of founders know secretly that their thing isn't working, but they want to  keep up with this front to everyone in the world that it is working and  they think they can fool people into funding them or working with them.

很多创始人都暗地里知道他们的东西行不通，但他们想跟上这条战线，让世界上的每个人都知道它在起作用，他们认为他们可以欺骗人们，让他们资助他们或与他们合作。

If you  can't convince yourself and you know this isn't really working, man, is that a good  time to pivot, right? Like you know more than anyone else about your business, so  you've got to listen to yourself and it's sometimes not stuff you want to hear  from yourself.

如果你不能说服自己，你知道这不是真正的工作，伙计，这是一个转向的好时机，对吗？就像你比任何人都更了解你的业务，所以你必须倾听自己的声音，有时候这不是你想从自己那里听到的东西。

Okay, let's talk about other pivotty stuff.

好的，让我们谈谈其他关键的东西。

If you pivot over and over  and over again, it causes whiplash.

如果你一次又一次地旋转，它会引起鞭打。

Whiplash is very bad because it causes founders to  give up and not want to work on this anymore and that actually kills the  company.

whiplash非常糟糕，因为它会导致创始人放弃，不再想在这方面工作，这实际上会扼杀公司。

Weirdly, it's more deadly to your company to get whiplash and get sad then  to work on a bad idea, because if you're having fun working on a bad  idea, you won't give up and then conceivably you can maybe make it work.

奇怪的是，对你的公司来说，得到鞭笞和悲伤比去做一个糟糕的想法更致命，因为如果你在一个糟糕的想法上工作很开心，你不会放弃，然后你可以想象你可能会让它奏效。

If  you get really sad and hate your life while you're working on your startup, you  will definitely not succeed and it's because you will give up.

如果你在创业的过程中变得非常悲伤并且憎恨你的生活，你肯定不会成功，因为你会放弃。

And so this is  weird, like it's kind of better to work on an idea that's not the best  one if you're really having fun.

所以这很奇怪，如果你真的很开心的话，最好是去研究一个不是最好的想法。

And then you just want to be in a  happy medium.

然后你只想处于一种快乐的中间状态。

Some founders pivot way too much and they'll probably watch this lecture and  then pivot once a day for six weeks.

一些创始人过多地转向，他们可能会观看这个讲座，然后每天转向一次，持续六周。

Don't do that.

别干那事。

And some people just  work on the same idea for five years and it's not working and they just  are really [inaudible] about it.

而有些人只是在相同的想法上工作了五年，它不起作用，他们只是真的[听不见]它。

Just find a happy medium like everything else in life.

就像生活中的其他事情一样，找到一个快乐的媒介。

 Another thing is it's really hard to have employees and be pivoting, so don't do  it.

另一件事是，拥有员工真的很难，所以不要这样做。

It just makes it slower and it makes them really sad and so trying  to scale up a team and taking all the advice here about how to scale  a team while you don't even know what your idea is or you think you're  going to change your idea, definitely not best practices.

这只会让它变得更慢，让他们真的很伤心，所以尝试扩大团队规模，接受这里所有关于如何扩大团队规模的建议，而你甚至不知道你的想法是什么，或者你认为你会改变你的想法，绝对不是最佳实践。

It only slows you down.

它只会减慢你的速度。

I  would only add people to the team after you know your idea is working and  you have confidence, otherwise it's just all downside.

我只会在你知道你的想法在起作用并且你有信心后才会加入团队，否则只会带来负面影响。

Okay, let's go to a different thing  here.

好的，让我们来做另一件事。

I made this up for this lecture and I came up with a subjective  notion of a quality score, just to give you a few criteria to evaluate an  idea.

我为这堂课编造了这个，我提出了一个主观的质量分数的概念，只是为了给你们几个标准，来评估一个想法。

Okay.

好吧。

And so what I did is there's four key things that I think  you could use to evaluate the quality of an idea and you could give them  a 1 to 10 and then you average those together to give an overall quality  score.

所以我做的是有四个关键的东西，我认为你可以用来评估一个想法的质量，你可以给他们一个1到10的分数，然后你把它们平均起来，给出一个整体质量分数。

Okay.

好吧。

So let me just go into detail on these.

所以让我来详细介绍一下这些。

How big of an  idea it seems to be, and again, this is the stuff I talked about earlier.

这似乎是一个多么大的想法，再一次，这就是我之前谈到的东西。

 Is this an obvious publicly traded company? Like I don't know, Tesla, hey, it's a  new car company, there's lots of publicly traded car companies.

这是一家明显的上市公司吗？就像我不知道，特斯拉，嘿，这是一家新的汽车公司，有很多公开上市的汽车公司。

That seems pretty big.

看起来挺大的。

A  new bank.

一家新银行。

There's lots of banks that are publicly traded.

有很多银行是公开交易的。

That seems pretty big.

看起来挺大的。

The  opposite of the spectrum is like, I don't know, a Subway.

光谱的反面就像，我不知道，地铁。

"I'm going to buy  a Subway franchise," you know? That's the other end of the spectrum.

“我要买一个地铁专营权，”你知道吗？那是光谱的另一端。

Or like, "Oh,  I'm going to import some stuff and sell it on eBay." Probably a little less  obvious how it's big.

或者说，“哦，我要进口一些东西，然后在eBay上出售。”可能不太明显它有多大。

The second one, founder market fit, is really, really key.

第二个，方正市场契合，是非常关键的。

So  again, a 10 out of 10 would be, "Hey, I was on the self driving  car team when I was an undergrad and then I worked on self driving cars  my whole career and so now I'm going to do a self driving car startup."  Yeah, that's a 10 out of 10.

所以，满分10分又是，“嘿，我上大学的时候是自动驾驶汽车团队的成员，然后我整个职业生涯都在研究自动驾驶汽车，所以现在我要做一个自动驾驶汽车的初创公司。”是啊，满分是10分。

A 0 out of 10 is like, "I'm  going to do some kind of advanced AI startup and I don't know how to  program." That's a 0 out of 10 right there.

满分为10的0表示，“我将进行某种高级AI启动，但我不知道如何编程。”那就是0分满分的10分。

Don't recommend that.

不推荐那样。

How easy is  it to get started on the idea is actually, I think, undersold.

开始这个想法有多容易，我认为，实际上是卖得不够好。

I don't know  if people realize, this is actually really key, is ideas that are easy to start  are highly recommended and there are so many really good ideas out there that never  work because the founders can't figure out how to get started and then someone in  the future does the same idea and has a much better way to get started  and then they win.

我不知道人们是否意识到，这实际上是非常关键的，很容易开始的想法被强烈推荐，有这么多非常好的想法从来都不会奏效，因为创始人不知道如何开始，然后有人在未来做同样的想法，有更好的方式开始，然后他们赢了。

And then people get bitter because they're like, "I had that  idea." So I would argue finding an idea that's easy to get started with is  just as important as the idea itself.

然后人们会变得痛苦，因为他们会说，“我有这个想法。”所以我认为找到一个容易上手的想法和想法本身一样重要。

And finally, early market feedback from customers and  this just means do people just want it immediately in sales, straightforward, or is it  just impossible? So let me give you some examples of companies that I worked with  and advised at YC that you may or may not have heard of.

最后，来自客户的早期市场反馈，这只是意味着人们只是希望它在销售中立即、直接，还是根本不可能？所以，让我给你一些我在YC工作过的公司的例子，你可能听说过也可能没有听说过。

Brex is  one.

布雷克斯就是其中之一。

They're in YC Winter '17, and I funded them to do a different idea,  and talked to them a lot during their pivot, and they pivoted during the batch.

他们在YC冬日‘17，我资助他们做一个不同的想法，并在他们的枢轴期间与他们进行了很多交谈，他们在批次中进行了枢轴转换。

 They got product market fit pretty quickly and they have now raised hundreds of millions  and are worth billions in two years.

他们很快就适应了产品市场，现在他们已经筹集了数亿美元，并在两年内价值数十亿美元。

So it's like one of those rare outlier  stories.

所以这就像是一个罕见的离群索居的故事。

I'm not saying this is common, but holy cow, I got a front row  seat to watching kind of the most epic pivot of all time, I think.

我不是说这很常见，但我想，我得到了一个前排座位来观看有史以来最史诗般的支点。

Maybe  there's other ones, but I was like, "Wow, that really worked." So let's talk about  the before and after.

也许还有其他的，但我想，“哇，这真的很管用。”所以让我们来谈谈之前和之后。

Here was what they started with.

这是他们的开始。

They had this idea for  a new VR hardware headset that you would use to do work or something.

他们有一个新的VR硬件头戴式耳机的想法，你可以用它来做工作或其他事情。

Here's  the scores I just put in, I put these in now, I didn't do these  at the time.

这是我刚刚输入的分数，我现在把这些放进去，我当时没有做这些。

How big does it seem? Yeah, it seems like medium big, like  VR headsets, there's no publicly traded ones, but that seems like the future, right? Founder  market fit, I give a 1 out of 10.

看起来有多大？是的，看起来像中等大小，就像VR头盔，没有公开交易的，但这看起来像是未来，对吧？方正市场适合，我给1分，满分10分。

These guys knew nothing about hardware  or optics or any of the things associated.

这些人对硬件或光学或任何相关的东西一无所知。

They were just FinTech software folks so  they had literally no idea what they were doing, and they were very up front  about that.

他们只是金融科技软件人员，所以他们真的不知道自己在做什么，而且他们非常坦率。

How easy it was to get started, that's only a two, and the  reason is they had to hire hardware people to build a prototype, not a good  sign.

这是多么容易开始，这只是两个，原因是他们不得不雇用硬件人员来建立一个原型，这不是一个好兆头。

They needed millions of dollars to build a prototype, not a good sign.

他们需要数百万美元来建造一个原型，这不是一个好兆头。

And  it would take like years and years and years of manufacturing.

这将需要很多年的制造。

So this was pretty  bad.

所以这很糟糕。

And then finally, early market feedback, they went and talked to people and they're  like, "Do you want to use this?" And no one wanted to use it.

最后，早期的市场反馈，他们去和人们交谈，他们说，“你想用这个吗？”没人想用它。

So  this was bad.

所以这很糟糕。

Okay.

好吧。

So overall score, 2 and a half out of 10.

所以总分是2.5分(满分10分)。

Okay,  post pivot.

好的，转轴。

Credit card for startups.

初创公司的信用卡。

That seemed pretty big.

看起来挺大的。

There's tons of publicly traded  comps of like FinTech companies.

像金融科技这样的上市公司数不胜数。

You know, again, even in startup land, there's Square, there's  Stripe, I mean there's lots of examples of that.

你知道，再一次，即使在初创公司的土地上，有广场，有条纹，我的意思是有很多这样的例子。

So I'd give that a 10  out of 10, I did at the time.

所以我会给它打满分10分，我当时就是这么做的。

Founder market fit, 10 out of 10.

方正市场适合，满分10分。

 The reason is they had started a FinTech company earlier in Brazil and it was  successful and they sold it for like $20 or $30 million.

原因是他们早些时候在巴西创办了一家金融科技公司，而且很成功，他们以大约2，000万美元的价格出售了它。

So they knew exactly  what they were doing and they could write all the code themselves and they could  ship it themselves and they had all these existing relationships.

所以他们非常清楚自己在做什么，他们可以自己编写所有的代码，他们可以自己发货，他们拥有所有这些现有的关系。

Man, is that such a  better fit.

伙计，这是不是更合适。

How easy it was to get started, I'm only giving this a 3  out of 10 because they actually ...

这是多么容易开始，我只给这3个满分10，因为他们实际上…

It's hard to launch a new credit card  product.

很难推出新的信用卡产品。

This is one where if you don't have founder market fit, I would not  necessarily try this at home.

这是一个如果你没有方正市场适合，我不一定会尝试在家里。

There was something about the founder market fit that made  it easy.

创始人市场的契合度让事情变得很容易。

And then finally the early market feedback I'm giving 8 out of 10  and it's because in the batch they were like, "Hey, do you have a credit  card? Do you want to be a customer?" And people were like, "Yes." And that  was the whole sales process.

最后，我给出的早期市场反馈是10个中的8个，因为在这批产品中，他们说，“嘿，你有信用卡吗？你想成为客户吗？”人们会说，“是的。”这就是整个销售过程。

I witnessed it multiple times.

我亲眼目睹了很多次。

So if that's your sales  process, good.

所以如果这是你的销售流程，很好。

It's like a three sentence sales process and people say "Yes, that is  good." Let's talk about Retool.

这就像是一个三句话的销售过程，人们说“是的，这很好。”让我们谈谈重新装备。

They're Winter '17 and they're a really good SaaS company  and honestly everyone should check it out and maybe use it.

他们是17年冬季，他们是一家非常好的SaaS公司，老实说，每个人都应该检查一下，也许会使用它。

It's a tool to  build internal tools.

它是一种构建内部工具的工具。

It's awesome.

它太棒了。

I'm encouraging all the YC startups use this to build  internal management pages.

我鼓励所有YC初创公司使用这个来构建内部管理页面。

It's actually like a really great product.

它实际上是一个非常棒的产品。

So that's what Retool is.

这就是Retool的含义。

 You should look at it.

你应该看看。

Pre pivot was Venmo for the UK.

Pre Pivot是英国的Venmo。

How big it  seems, seems pretty big, like Venmo is big.

它看起来有多大，看起来很大，就像Venmo很大一样。

Founder market fit, 3 out of 10,  they didn't really know anything about FinTech, but they managed to get a launch so  there was something there.

方正市场契合，10个人中有3个，他们并不真正了解金融科技，但他们设法推出了一个产品，所以有一些东西在那里。

How easy it was to get started, I'm giving that a  7 out of 10, it's because they already launched, they'd already had a bunch of  users then.

这是多么容易开始，我给它打了7分，因为他们已经推出了，他们当时已经有了一大堆用户。

So that was pretty impressive.

这真是令人印象深刻。

Early market feedback though was only 3 out  of 10 and the reason is no one wanted to pay and they were losing  money on every transaction.

然而，早期的市场反馈只有3/10，原因是没有人愿意支付，而且他们在每笔交易上都在亏损。

So there's all these reasons that this wasn't really working and  so they decided to pivot even though this is an example of the insidious sort  of traction, right? They had enough traction that it was like hard to decide to  give up on this because they had users and it was kind of working.

所以有所有这些原因，这并不是真正起作用的，所以他们决定转向，尽管这是一种潜在的牵引力的例子，对吧？他们有足够的吸引力，所以很难决定放弃，因为他们有用户，这是一种工作。

So  that was a tricky one.

所以这是个棘手的问题。

Anyway, Retool post pivot is the no-code internal tools builder.

无论如何，retool post Pivot是无代码的内部工具构建器。

 I think it seems like a 10 out of 10 because 80% of all software  built is for internal consumption, not external consumption, like in big companies, and so that  seems like a big market to me.

我认为这看起来像是满分10分，因为80%的软件都是内部消费的，而不是像大公司那样的外部消费，所以对我来说这是一个很大的市场。

Founder market fit, 10 out of 10.

方正市场适合，满分10分。

One  of the founders had made something like this at his college internship and so he  had a very good idea of what the product should be and had relevant to  it.

其中一位创始人在大学实习时做了这样的事情，所以他对产品应该是什么有一个非常好的想法，并与之相关。

It was easy to get started.

开始很容易。

They built it in two weeks and got  their first customers.

他们在两周内建成了它，并获得了第一批客户。

Great.

太棒了。

And early market feedback only giving a 5 out of 10.

而早期的市场反馈只给出了5分(满分10分)。

 People were interested in it, but they weren't sure they wanted to trust some new  startup to this thing, so this one did not fly off the proverbial shelves.

人们对它很感兴趣，但他们不确定他们是否想要信任一些新的创业公司，所以这一家并没有从俗话说的架子上掉下来。

They  managed to get some users but it was not immediate obvious product market fit.

他们设法获得了一些用户，但这并不是立即明显的产品市场适合。

They  had to build it out a bit.

他们不得不把它建起来一点。

So that was a great pivot.

所以这是一个伟大的支点。

Next we  got Magic.

接下来我们有魔术师。

They were in Winter '15, they pivoted during the batch, and what's great  about them is they built a profitable and sustainable company.

他们是在15年冬天，他们在批次中旋转，而他们的伟大之处是他们建立了一个有利可图的可持续发展的公司。

Yay.

耶。

I wish we all  could do that, right? How did they do it? They started off with this idea  for a blood pressure coach where there was an app and you enter your blood  pressure and it would tell you how to lower your blood pressure.

我希望我们都能做到，对吧？他们是怎么做到的？他们开始有一个血压教练的想法，那里有一个应用程序，你输入你的血压，它会告诉你如何降低你的血压。

It didn't seem  like a huge idea, 2 out of 10.

这看起来不像是一个伟大的想法，10个中有2个。

Founder market fit, they didn't know anything  about health whatsoever or much along those lines, so that's probably just a 2 out  of 10.

方正市场契合，他们对健康一无所知，或者说他们对健康一无所知，所以可能只有2分(满分10分)。

How easy it was to get started, 8 out of 10 because they  built the app really quickly and they got users really quickly and they followed all  the advice.

这是多么容易开始，8/10，因为他们建立应用程序非常快，他们得到用户非常快，他们遵循所有的建议。

Good for them.

对他们来说很好。

And then the early market feedback was like not good.

然后早期的市场反馈好像不太好。

 Everyone was really polite and no one used the dang thing.

每个人都很有礼貌，没有人用那个该死的东西。

Like their usage was  just horrible.

好像他们的用法太可怕了。

So this one was again was kind of obvious they should pivot.

所以这一次，很明显，他们应该转向。

They  realized it on their own pretty quickly.

他们自己很快就意识到了这一点。

And then they built a bunch of prototypes.

然后他们制造了一堆原型。

 They actually built the Magic prototype in a weekend.

他们实际上在一个周末就建成了魔术原型。

No joke.

不是开玩笑。

This is actually true.

这其实是真的。

 A not an exaggeration.

一点也不夸张。

And they put it on Hacker News and it went to  number one and got like 2000 upvotes and it blew up overnight.

他们把它放在Hacker News上，它登上了第一名，获得了2000张选票，一夜之间就爆炸了。

I don't know  if anyone remembers this thing, but it went like crazy viral and they got all  this press, like it was the most ...

我不知道有没有人记得这件事，但它就像疯狂的病毒一样，他们得到了所有的媒体，就像它是最…

It was an example of a shots  on goal thing I was talking about earlier where they had like five ideas and  there's no way I would've known or they would've known that this would be the  thing that would capture the world's imagination.

这是我之前谈到的一个关于射门的例子，他们有五个想法，我不可能知道，他们也不会知道这会是一个吸引世界想象力的东西。

But it did.

但它确实发生了。

And so not obvious founder  market fit on this one either, but it was very easy to get started, it  got really good early market feedback, and it seems pretty big.

所以不是很明显的创始人市场适合这个，但它很容易开始，它得到了非常好的早期市场反馈，而且它看起来很大。

So that was great.

那真是太棒了。

 It also inadvertently inspired tons and tons of clones.

它也在不经意间激发了无数的克隆人。

So I would argue that anyone  that's doing chatbot stuff, it's sort of like a direct descendant about when this thing  blew up and everyone was like, "Oh chatbots are the future," was sort of like  second order effects from this going so crazy viral and inspiring so many people.

所以我认为，任何做聊天机器人的人，就像是这个东西爆炸时的直系后代，每个人都说，“哦，聊天机器人就是未来，”这有点像是这种疯狂的病毒传播的二阶效应，鼓舞了这么多的人。

Segment,  they're in YC Summer '11.

部分，他们在YC Summer‘11。

They pivoted a bunch of times including years after the  batch.

他们旋转了很多次，包括批次之后的几年。

It took them a really long time to get it going.

他们花了很长时间才把它弄好。

They didn't even  pivot during the batch and now they're worth billions and it's a really good company.

他们甚至没有在批处理过程中转向，现在他们价值数十亿美元，这是一家非常好的公司。

 It's a top data infrastructure company.

这是一家顶级的数据基础设施公司。

So pre pivot, they had this thing that was  a classroom feedback tool where you would give it to students in a classroom and  they could say if they were lost or not I think was what the feature  was.

所以Pre Pivot，他们有一个课堂反馈工具，你可以把它给教室里的学生，他们可以说，如果他们迷路了，我认为这就是功能。

So if you were confused, you would push a button and it would tell  the professor.

所以如果你感到困惑，你可以按下一个按钮，它就会告诉教授。

Okay, didn't seem huge in my opinion.

好吧，在我看来并不大。

Founder market fit, well they were  students and they were young, so I'd give that like a 5 out of 10.

创始人市场契合，他们是学生，而且他们都很年轻，所以我会给出5分(满分10分)。

 They weren't experts on education, but they understood the audience.

他们不是教育专家，但他们理解观众。

It was easy to get  started.

开始很容易。

They built it really fast.

他们很快就建好了。

And the early market feedback was actually decent where  professors liked it and they got a bunch of schools to adopt this thing.

在教授们喜欢的地方，早期的市场反馈实际上是不错的，他们让一大堆学校采用了这种方法。

So  their sales were successful, but ultimately this was not, you know, it took them on  the order of years to discard this one.

所以他们的销售是成功的，但最终这并不是，你知道，他们花了几年的时间才放弃了这个。

And yeah, it's good that they pivoted  because now they're doing ...

是的，他们转过来很好，因为现在他们在做.

Segment again, which everyone should use, it's a data collection  tool.

再次分段，这是每个人都应该使用的，它是一个数据收集工具。

That one did not seem obviously big.

那个看起来并不明显很大。

Have anyone here use Segment? It's this  JavaScript thing you put on your page and it connects to other tools.

这里有人用过Segment吗？这是你放在页面上的JavaScript东西，它连接到其他工具。

It was  less obvious how that would be a publicly traded company at the time, but the  founder market fit was great because they built so much analytics stuff.

当时还不太清楚这将如何成为一家上市公司，但创始人市场的契合度很好，因为他们构建了太多的分析工具。

They were world  experts on analytics already when they built it.

当他们建造它的时候，他们已经是世界上的分析专家了。

It was easy to get started because  they literally built this thing and open sourced it and gave it away for free  and people begged for them to support it.

这很容易开始，因为他们确实构建了这个东西，并将其开源，然后免费赠送，人们恳求他们支持它。

Like, the market begged for this product  to exist.

就像，市场乞求这个产品存在。

They didn't think this was the company.

他们不认为这就是公司。

They just had this thing on  GitHub and so many people were obsessed with this thing that they built.

他们只是在GitHub上有这个东西，那么多的人痴迷于他们建造的这个东西。

They're like,  "Well, I guess the market is telling us we should make this the company," and  they did it.

他们说，“嗯，我想市场告诉我们应该让这家公司，”他们做到了。

So that I would say is easy to get started and really  good market feedback, you know, with the market's begging for something, and that you don't  even think it's good and they have to convince you it's good, that's a pretty  good sign.

所以我会说，很容易开始，市场反馈真的很好，你知道，随着市场的乞求，你甚至不认为这是好的，他们必须让你相信这是好的，这是一个非常好的迹象。

And so that was a good pivot.

所以这是一个很好的支点。

Okay.

好吧。

In summary, I tried to  give you those examples just to give you real, real, real life examples of stuff  that I personally worked on just to show the before and after and how these  decisions are really made.

总之，我试着给你那些例子，只是为了给你一些真实的，真实生活中的例子，我个人工作过的东西，只是为了展示之前和之后，以及这些决定是如何做出的。

And so changing our idea is part of a startup.

因此，改变我们的想法是初创公司的一部分。

The  sooner the better because of the opportunity cost and the shots on goal type of  stuff.

越快越好，因为机会成本和射门类型的东西。

And when you're considering changing your ideas, especially the early stages, it shouldn't feel  like a big deal.

当你在考虑改变你的想法时，特别是在早期阶段，这不应该是一个大问题。

You should probably do it all the time, and following best  practices is recommended.

您可能应该一直这样做，并建议遵循以下最佳实践。

Hopefully I gave you some good pointers on what those best practices  are.

希望我在这些最佳实践方面给了您一些好的提示。

But if you are really scientific about this, you can dramatically increase the odds  that your startup will work.

但是，如果你真的对此很科学，你可以极大地增加你的创业公司成功的几率。

Great.

太棒了。

That's it for me.

对我来说就是这样。

Thanks.

谢谢。

All right, we're going  to do some questions.

好的，我们要问几个问题。

Yeah.

嗯。

All right.
Speaker 2:How important are barriers to entry when you're considering pivoting and starting a different direction?
Dalton Caldwell:How important are barriers to entry? I would put that under the variable around founder  excitement.

好的。演讲者2：当你考虑转向并开始一个不同的方向时，进入的障碍有多重要？道尔顿·考德威尔：进入壁垒有多重要？我会把它归入围绕创始人兴奋的变量之下。

And so if you, yourself, are like in your heart, "I'm going to build  this thing," and everyone's going to copy it and there's no barrier to entry, that's  a good sign it may not be great, but again, in the case of Magic  or many of these others, there is basically no barrier to entry other than execution.

所以如果你，你自己，心里想，“我要造这个东西，”每个人都要复制它，并且没有进入的障碍，这是一个好的迹象，它可能不是很好，但同样，在魔术或其他许多这样的情况下，基本上没有进入的障碍，除了执行之外的其他障碍。

 But if you are really worried about the idea, even at inception time, that's probably  a good signal you want to think about it.

但是如果你真的担心这个想法，即使在开始的时候，这可能是一个很好的信号，你想要考虑它。

Does that make sense? So it's  really the in the eye of the beholder of the founder, if that's the thing  they're most worried about versus not that worried about.
Speaker 2:Okay, thank you.
Speaker 3:So, thanks Dalton for the talk.

这说得通吗？所以这真的是创始人眼里的东西，如果这是他们最担心的事情，而不是那么担心的话。演讲者2：好的，谢谢。演讲者3：那么，谢谢道尔顿的演讲。

So, [inaudible] those pre pivot type [inaudible 00:00:28:24]?
Dalton Caldwell:Yeah.

那么，[听不见]那些前枢轴类型[听不见00：00：28：24]？道尔顿·考德威尔：是的。

So, in the case of Brex, they'd built a really successful company before and  they were very ambitious and so I just had lots of confidence.

所以，在Brex的例子中，他们之前建立了一个非常成功的公司，他们非常有野心，所以我有很大的信心。

Even they weren't  really sure that that was the right idea for them.

就连他们也不确定这对他们来说是不是正确的想法。

They clearly had the technical  skills on that.

他们显然有这方面的技术技能。

I think the other example is the same with Magic.

我认为另一个例子与魔术是相同的。

They built  a product, they launched it, they had early traction, they had great skills on the  team, and Retool, they shipped a pretty popular app in the UK that had tens  of thousands of users.

他们建立了一个产品，他们发布了它，他们有早期的吸引力，他们在团队中有很好的技能，并且重新配备了工具，他们在英国发布了一个非常受欢迎的应用程序，拥有数万用户。

You know, they had something.

你知道，他们有一些东西。

And so all of those, they  kind of had a thing that was in a decent state and there was something  really exciting about it and that was the major reason why.

所以所有这些，他们都有一样东西处于一个很好的状态，有一些真正令人兴奋的东西，这就是为什么要这样做的主要原因。

And I think that's  pretty consistent with all the advice you're getting here, right? Like if you really make  something and give it to people and you have all the right stuff, people will  take a chance on things.

我认为这与你在这里得到的所有建议非常一致，对吧？比如，如果你真的做了一些东西，并把它给了人们，你有了所有正确的东西，人们就会在事情上冒险。

Let me go a different part of the room.

让我去房间的另一个地方。

Yeah.
Speaker 4:All right.

嗯。扬声器4：好的。

[inaudible 00:29:20].

[听不见00：29：20]。

How do you deal with the situation when the founder thinks  that it's time to pivot but the team doesn't think it is?
Dalton Caldwell:Okay, the question is how do you deal with when the founder thinks it's time  to pivot and team doesn't? So this is actually one of those things why it's  bad to have a team this early is because you will create bad morale issues  if you pivot with a team, especially a large team.

当创始人认为是时候转向而团队却不这么认为时，你如何处理这种情况？道尔顿·考德威尔：好的，问题是当创始人认为是时候转向而团队却不这么认为时，你该如何处理？所以，这实际上就是为什么这么早拥有一个团队是不好的原因之一，因为如果你以团队为中心，特别是一个大型团队，你会造成士气低落的问题。

And it's because they were  hired to do a job.

这是因为他们被雇来做一项工作。

If you're a team member and you're working somewhere, you're  working at Slack and you're making a video game, and they're like, "Hey, just kidding  and we're going to do this other thing." And you're like, "What the ...

如果你是一个团队成员，你在某个地方工作，你在Slack工作，你在做一个视频游戏，他们会说，“嘿，开玩笑，我们要做另一件事。”你就像，“这是什么.

Like  what?" People have a career, they have a goal, they're not thinking the way a  founder thinks.

比如什么？“人们有一个职业，他们有一个目标，他们不是以创始人的方式思考。

And so imagine, have you ever worked somewhere where they pivoted? It's pretty  lame, so putting people through that is rough.

想象一下，你有没有在他们旋转的地方工作过？这很差劲，所以让人们经历这件事是很艰难的。

If you want to try to retain  these people, you want to really reason with them and listen to them.

如果你想留住这些人，你要真正和他们讲道理，倾听他们的意见。

But ultimately  someone could be like, "I signed up for project X and you want to do  project Y," it may end up that you need to part ways and it's no  fault, it's just a lot of times people join a company for a mission or  an idea and if you change the idea it's really easy for the employees to  be like, "I'm not interested in this." Over there.
Speaker 5:Okay, so how can we decide in the initial phase how big the market is?  Like [inaudible 00:30:38], maybe because [inaudible] started they have the idea that it is going  to [inaudible 00:30:45]?
Dalton Caldwell:So how do you know how big something is? I tried to give you some  examples but I think that you don't have to overthink it.

但最终有人可能会说，“我注册了X项目，你想做Y项目”，这可能最终你需要分道扬镳，这没有错，只是很多时候，人们为了一个任务或一个想法而加入一家公司，如果你改变了想法，员工很容易会说，“我对这个不感兴趣。”在那边。演讲者5：好的，那么我们如何在初始阶段确定市场有多大？就像[听不见的00：30：38]，也许是因为[听不见]开始，他们有这样的想法[听不见的00：30：45]？道尔顿·考德威尔：那么你怎么知道事情有多大呢？我试着给你举一些例子，但我认为你不必多想。

If people will give  you lots of money for it quickly and easily, and it's very obvious how you  make lots of money quickly, that's usually a good sign.

如果人们会为它快速和容易地给你很多钱，而且很明显你如何快速地赚很多钱，这通常是一个好的迹象。

I don't think looking up  Gartner studies or stuff like that is a good use of your time.

我不认为查找Gartner的研究或类似的东西是一个很好的利用你的时间。

But if  it's really obvious how you can go to get lots of revenue really fast without  convoluted ideas, that's a good sign.

但如果你真的很明显如何在没有令人费解的想法的情况下非常快地获得大量收入，这是一个好迹象。

Versus if you're just doing something that it's hard  to imagine someone will ever pay for or you're just going to have to lose  hundreds of millions of dollars or raise hundreds of million dollars, that's usually a sign  it's going to be rough.

相反，如果你只是在做一些很难想象有人会为之买单的事情，或者你将不得不损失数亿美元或筹集数亿美元，这通常是一个信号，它将会是一个艰难的征兆。

And so it's kind of on you, I guess, is  what I'm trying to say.

所以我想这就是我想说的，这是你的责任。

Yeah.

嗯。

Let's do you, blue.

我们来做你，蓝色。

Yeah.

嗯。

What's up?
Speaker 6:So you mentioned about not having enough traction and too much [inaudible] is better than  no traction versus a little bit traction.

出什么事啦？演讲者6：所以你提到没有足够的牵引力，太多[听不见]总比没有牵引力好，而不是一点点牵引力。

And so what is that little bit that  you should [inaudible] to even know you had that [inaudible 00:31:48]?
Dalton Caldwell:Okay.

那么，你应该[听不见]甚至知道你有这种感觉的那一点是什么[听不见的00：31：48]？道尔顿·考德威尔：好的。

What is the kind of little bit of traction you should avoid? It's basically  where you're either flat, like you get some early users of some sort, or customers  of some sort, and then it's sort of flatlined and you feel like you're pushing  a boulder up hill and no matter what you do, you're still flatline and the  thing's not working.

你应该避免什么样的一点点牵引力？基本上就是你要么是平坦的，就像你得到了一些早期的用户，或者是某种类型的客户，然后它有点平坦，你感觉就像你把一块巨石推上了山，无论你做什么，你仍然是平坦的，这东西不起作用。

Like you feel like you're putting in tons and tons of effort  and there's just not much feedback or pay off that things are getting easier, if  anything they might be getting harder.

就像你感觉你投入了无数的努力，只是没有太多的反馈或回报，事情变得越来越容易，如果有的话，他们可能会变得更难。

This is super subjective stuff, I admit that, but  it's very obvious when you talk to a founder in office hours when they don't  have product market fit, it's because they're exasperated that no matter what they try and  they're trying everything, it's just not working and so flatline is a good way to  detect that, is if your overall growth is flatlined.

这是非常主观的东西，我承认，但当你在办公时间与创始人交谈时，他们的产品不适合市场，这是非常明显的，因为他们很恼火，无论他们尝试什么，他们尝试一切，它只是不起作用，所以平面线是一个很好的方法来检测这一点，如果你的整体增长是平坦的。

Yeah.

嗯。

In the back.
Speaker 7:You said in your introduction, you are the head of admissions.

在后面。演讲者7：你在介绍中说，你是招生主任。

We are interested in  applying for the main school.

我们对申请主要学校很感兴趣。

We are [inaudible] enterprise pre launch.

我们是[听不见]企业预发布。

What should we be  focusing on for the next [inaudible 00:32:51]? I think the deadline is September 25th.
Dalton Caldwell:Okay.

接下来我们应该关注什么[听不见的00：32：51]？我想截止日期是9月25日。道尔顿·考德威尔：好的。

What should we focus on for applying to YC and we're pre launch.

我们应该专注于什么来申请YC，我们已经准备好了。

You  know, we don't need to get in a whole thing here, but you should not  be pre launch.

你知道，我们不需要在这里做一个完整的事情，但你不应该在发射前。

That's a great way to demonstrate that you are ...

这是一个很好的方式来证明你是.。

Again, even  if you need to change your idea that demonstrates competence, like the act of launching  and going through the process alone demonstrates really good stuff.

再说一次，即使你需要改变你的想法来证明你的能力，比如启动和完成这个过程就证明了真正好的东西。

Even if you end up  needing to change your idea.

即使你最终需要改变你的想法。

The toughest thing is if there's, yeah, if it's prelaunch.

最难的是如果有，是的，如果它是发射前的。

 Yes?
Speaker 8:I'm curious about app.net, and like two parts.

是?演讲者8：我对app.net很好奇，喜欢两个部分。

One is what was your thinking behind  shutting down as opposed to pivoting and two, do you think the timing was just  off? Because a lot of crypto networks right now are launching something similar where there's  a community effort to build something.
Dalton Caldwell:Yeah.

一是你在关闭而不是旋转背后的想法是什么，第二，你认为时机刚刚好吗？因为现在很多密码网络都在推出类似的东西，那里有一个社区的努力来构建一些东西。道尔顿·考德威尔：是的。

Question was about one of my companies, I guess I didn't get into this  ...

问题是关于我的一家公司，我想我没有进入这个.

I probably pivoted personally seven or eight times and I've done a lot of  things at my startups and so he had a specific question about one of them.

我可能亲自旋转了七八次，我在我的初创公司做了很多事情，所以他对其中一个有一个具体的问题。

 I would say for the app.net use case, I did not enjoy working on it  anymore.

我会说，对于app.net用例，我不再喜欢在它上面工作了。

Like honest to God, that's exactly the advice I just gave here.

就像对上帝诚实一样，这正是我在这里给的建议。

I was  not enjoying myself and so I'm not sure what to say about the market, that's  a long conversation, but to follow my own advice, I lost enthusiasm and excitement that  that was a good use of my time.

我不喜欢自己，所以我不知道对市场说什么，这是一个很长的对话，但按照我自己的建议，我失去了热情和兴奋，这是一个很好的利用我的时间。

And so that was how I made  my decision.

这就是我做出决定的方式。

Yes?
Speaker 9:So Kevin talked about SISP, Solution in Search of a Problem course lecture, and we're  in a situation where we worked on something for a year and we feel that  it can be used for a different problem, right? It works really well for a  different problem, so it is kind of in that zone, a solution in search of  a problem, so would you count that as a pivot or, I mean-
Dalton Caldwell:Yes.

是?演讲者9：所以Kevin谈到了SISP，Solution in Search of Problem Course Lesson，我们现在的情况是我们花了一年的时间研究一些东西，我们觉得它可以用来解决不同的问题，对吧？它对不同的问题非常有效，所以它有点在那个区域，一个寻找问题的解决方案，所以你会把它算作一个支点吗，或者，我的意思是-道尔顿·考德威尔：是的。

Okay.

好吧。

So, we built this thing for a year and it's not taking off,  but we realize there might be a different market to sell it to.

所以，我们花了一年的时间制造这个东西，它不会起飞，但我们意识到可能会有一个不同的市场来销售它。

And so  my answer would be, can you test this really fast? And so this is what  always I tell people when they have these forks in the road, is if you  can find a way to test this other market in like a week or two  or three weeks, heck yeah.

所以我的答案是，你能测试得很快吗？所以这就是我总是告诉人们的，当他们在路上有这些岔路的时候，就是如果你能找到一种方法在一周或两三周内测试这个另一个市场，见鬼耶。

But if it's like, "Well we need to spend another  year on this with no market feedback whatsoever," that sounds rough.

但如果是这样的话，“我们需要在这上面再花一年时间，没有任何市场反馈”，这听起来很粗糙。

And so especially if  you put lots of time into something, look for ways to very quickly validate or  test it or get customers because my guess is you built a lot of stuff  and hopefully you can get quick market feedback that you can get customers fast in  this new market.

因此，尤其是如果你在某件事情上投入了大量时间，请寻找非常快速验证或测试它或获得客户的方法，因为我猜你构建了很多东西，希望你可以快速获得市场反馈，从而在这个新市场上快速获得客户。

Yeah, go ahead.
Speaker 10:Let me just add one thing to that.

是的，去吧。演讲者10：让我再补充一件事。

So Solution in Search of a Problem,  this is a concept of avoiding this when you're first starting the company and so  you don't want to be building something without having a user or a problem in  mind because it makes it much more difficult when you're starting your startup.

所以在寻找问题的解决方案中，这是一种在你刚开始创办公司时避免这种情况的概念，所以你不想在没有考虑到用户或问题的情况下构建一些东西，因为这会让你在开始创业时变得更加困难。

If you  already have the thing built, then the advice is not to be like, 'Oh, I'm  like, I don't have a problem that I've identified, therefore I should abandon all the  work that I've done." And so like those are independent things.

如果你已经建立了这个东西，那么建议不是这样的，‘哦，我就像，我没有发现的问题，因此我应该放弃我已经做的所有工作。“所以像那些是独立的东西一样。

And so once you  realize that you're in that situation, you're like, "Oh that's going to be difficult," the  question is like, "Oh, do I need a pivot, do I need to change, or  am I going to eventually find a good fit for that problem?" So the whole  thing is SISP just makes it much more difficult for you.

所以一旦你意识到自己处于这种情况，你就会说，“哦，这将是很困难的，”问题是，“哦，我需要一个支点，我需要改变吗，还是我最终会找到一个很好的解决这个问题的方法？”所以整个事情就是SISP让你变得更加困难。

So you're in this  situation and the question is basically like, "Hey, you should probably pivot into wherever the  growth you may find."
Dalton Caldwell:I think last question, what's up?
Speaker 11:Is there a dividing line between fast and not fast?
Dalton Caldwell:Yes.

所以你在这种情况下，问题基本上就像是，“嘿，你可能应该把重心放在任何你能找到的增长的地方。”道尔顿·考德威尔：我认为最后一个问题，怎么了？演讲者11：快速和不快速之间有分界线吗？道尔顿·考德威尔：是的。

Question, is there a dividing line between fast and not fast? This is one  of those interesting subjective things where someone ...

问，快速和不快速之间有没有分界线？这是其中一件有趣的主观的事情，其中有人.。

There's like anecdotes of people that go  off and spend five years building stuff in a vacuum and those are great.

有这样的轶事，人们离开了，花了五年时间在真空中建造东西，这些都很棒。

I  put that in the anecdote session I gave earlier that sometimes people do build things  in a vacuum for five years and it's a great idea.

我在之前的轶事会议中提到了这一点，有时人们确实会在真空中建造东西长达五年，这是一个很好的想法。

Hooray.

万岁。

But in general,  I consider fast or not fast for, I think it's context dependent.

但总的来说，我考虑快或不快，因为我认为它取决于上下文。

If you're doing  like a biotech then it might be months or years, but if you're just doing  something that's pure software and you could build pretty quickly and get users pretty quickly,  you want to see your iteration cycle on the order of weeks, like major progress  on the order of weeks, if not months.

如果你像生物科技那样做，那么它可能需要几个月或几年，但是如果你只是做一些纯软件的事情，你可以很快地构建并很快得到用户，你希望看到你的迭代周期在几周的数量级上，就像主要的进展在数周的数量级，如果不是几个月的话。

Definitely weeks.

绝对是几周。

And if your iteration cycle  to try a new idea and test it out or launch a version or go  get a bunch of customer feedback is on the order of months or longer, that's  probably too slow.

如果您尝试一个新想法并测试它或发布一个版本或获取一堆客户反馈的迭代周期大约是几个月或更长时间，那么这可能太慢了。

And again, I know this is tricky.

再说一次，我知道这很棘手。

Everyone always pushes me and  they're like, "Well what's the actual metric?" It's just super context dependent, right? And this  is why I try to give you concrete examples.

每个人都会推我，他们会说，“好吧，实际的度量是多少？”它只是超级依赖于上下文，对吧？这就是为什么我试着给你们一些具体的例子。

All those companies had different cycles.

所有这些公司都有不同的周期。

 In the case of Magic, that was a really fast cycle.

在魔术的情况下，这是一个非常快的周期。

It was literally days  to go through that pivot iteration.

从字面上讲，这是通过轴心迭代的几天时间。

In the case of Brex, that was months.

在Brex的案例中，这是几个月的时间。

And  so I think it really depends on the idea.
Speaker 11:For software, less than 10 weeks, is that a good rule of thumb?
Dalton Caldwell:Yeah.

所以我认为这真的取决于想法。演讲者11：对于软件来说，不到10周，这是一个好的经验法则吗？道尔顿·考德威尔：是的。

I think for software, less than 10 weeks, at least to feel like you've  made major progress and you've learned a lot.

我认为对于软件来说，不到10周，至少感觉你已经取得了很大的进步，你学到了很多。

This is a question I ask people  a lot.

这是一个我经常问人们的问题。

What have you learned? And if you can't articulate that you're still learning  things constantly and you're reassessing some of the assumptions you made and changing them, that's  a good sign you're not moving fast enough.

你学到了什么？如果你不能清楚地表达你仍然在不断学习，并且你正在重新评估你所做的一些假设并改变它们，这是一个很好的迹象，表明你的行动还不够快。

You should be constantly learning new stuff.

你应该不断学习新的东西。

Cool.

很好。

Cool.

很好。

Thanks everybody.


谢谢大家。
