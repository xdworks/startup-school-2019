# Michael Seibel - How to Plan an MVP

Michael Seibel:My name is Michael, I work here at Y Combinator.

Michael Seibel：我的名字是Michael，我在Y Combinator工作。

I help run the accelerator,  before that I did two YC startups, one in 2007 and one in 2012.

我帮助运行加速器，在此之前我做了两个YC初创公司，一个在2007年，一个在2012年。

And  today I'm going to talk to you about Minimum Viable Products, so MVP.

今天我要和你们谈谈最低限度的可行产品，所以MVP。

We always  yell at founders to not use jargon, yet we have this whole set of stupid  startup jargon, and MVP is one of them.

我们总是对创始人大喊大叫，让他们不要使用行话，然而我们却有一整套愚蠢的创业行话，MVP就是其中之一。

When you think about an MVP, you  just think about something ridiculously simple, this is the first thing you can give to  the very first set of users you want to target, in order to see if  you can deliver any value at all to them.

当你想到MVP时，你只会想到一些非常简单的事情，这是你可以给你想要瞄准的第一组用户的第一件事，为了看看你是否能为他们提供任何价值。

That's all it is, it's extremely  simple.

就是这样，非常简单。

I know you guys had a talk last week about how to come up  with ideas, how to come up with problems you want to solve.

我知道你们上周谈过如何想出点子，如何提出你们想要解决的问题。

What I will  tell you is, that it is helpful to talk to some users before you decide  to build your MVP.

我要告诉你的是，在决定构建MVP之前，与一些用户交谈是很有帮助的。

This doesn't mean you have to go into a three year  kind of research situation, or you have to work in industry for 10 years, but  some conversations are helpful.

这并不意味着你必须进入一个三年的研究环境，或者你必须在行业工作10年，但一些对话是有帮助的。

It's even more helpful if you're your own user, so you  can tell whether your product's working for you.

如果你是自己的用户，这会更有帮助，这样你就可以知道你的产品是否适合你。

I always get this strange question of  how do I get my first users, which always kind of confuses me, because theoretically  you decide to solve a problem that you know someone has, so the way you  get your first user is you talk to that person that you know has the  problem.

我总是遇到这样一个奇怪的问题：如何获得我的第一个用户，这总是让我感到困惑，因为从理论上讲，你决定解决一个你知道有人有问题的问题，所以你获得第一个用户的方式就是与你知道有问题的人交谈。

And if it's you, it's even easier.

如果是你，那就更容易了。

So if you are building a product  for a mysterious set of users that you have no idea who they are, question  that slightly, very slightly.

因此，如果你正在为一群你不知道他们是谁的神秘用户构建产品，那就稍微问一下，非常轻微。

Okay.

好吧。

So, the goal of a pre-launch startup is extremely simple.

所以，一个发射前的初创公司的目标非常简单。

 Step one, launch quickly.

第一步，快点发射。

This is something that's been part of the YC ethos from  the very beginning, and it's been great advice for 10 years, and it continues to  be great advice.

这一点从一开始就是YC精神的一部分，10年来一直是很好的建议，而且仍然是很好的建议。

If you can walk away from one thing from this presentation, it's  launch something bad quickly, that's it.

如果你可以从这个演示文稿中摆脱一件事，那就是迅速推出一些不好的东西，就是这样。

Literally, the rest of what I'm going to say  is basically going to be re-summarized versions of that same thing.

从字面上讲，我要说的其余内容基本上都是对同一件事的重新总结。

The second thing that  obviously a startup needs to do, is get some initial customers.

很明显，创业公司需要做的第二件事，就是获得一些最初的客户。

Get anyone using your  product.

让任何人使用你的产品。

You don't have to have a vision of how you get everyone using it,  but just anyone interacting and seeing if they get value out of the product.

你不需要有一个如何让每个人都使用它的愿景，而是每个人都在互动，看看他们是否能从产品中获得价值。

You'd  be surprised at how many founders journeys end before a single user has actually interacted  with a product they've created.

你会惊讶地发现，在一个用户真正与他们创建的产品进行互动之前，有多少创始人的旅程结束了。

It's very, very common, so please get past this step,  it's extremely important.

这是非常，非常常见的，所以请通过这一步，这是非常重要的。

The next one is, talk to your users, any of them after  you've launched this MVP, and get feedback.

下一个是，与你的用户交谈，在你启动这个MVP之后，他们中的任何一个人，并获得反馈。

This is one that's also a extremely common  mistake, because most founders in their heads have an idea of what they want to  build.

这也是一个非常常见的错误，因为大多数创始人在他们的头脑中都有他们想要构建的想法。

And so they kind of have this weird feeling that, if I haven't built  the full thing yet, getting feedback on the shitty initial thing is kind of useless.

所以他们有一种奇怪的感觉，如果我还没有建立完整的东西，在糟糕的初始事物上获得反馈是没有用的。

 Of course it's not going to work, it's not the full thing.

当然不会起作用，这不是全部。

The full thing  is going to take three years, $10 million, a whole team, so feedback on the  little thing is useless.

完整的工作需要三年，1000万美元，整个团队，所以对小事情的反馈是无用的。

The reality is that, in some ways the full thing is  this really awesome idea in your head that you should keep in your head, but  it should be very, very flexible, because it might turn out the full thing that  you want to build, isn't what your customers want at all.

现实是，在某些方面，完整的东西是你头脑中这个非常棒的想法，你应该把它保存在你的脑袋里，但它应该非常灵活，因为它可能最终会变成你想要的完整的东西，而不是你的客户想要的东西。

So I have this  saying, hold the problem you're solving tightly, hold the customer tightly, hold the solution you're  building loosely.

所以我有这样的说法，紧紧抓住你正在解决的问题，紧紧抓住客户，松散地抓住你正在构建的解决方案。

Last and most important, iterate, and I'd like to kind of distinguish between  iterating and pivoting.

最后也是最重要的，迭代，我想区分一下迭代和旋转。

A lot of founders, once they've figured out how to build something,  fall in love with it.

很多创始人，一旦他们想出了如何构建某种东西，就会爱上它。

And so if it doesn't work for a certain set  of users, they start thinking, "Well, I wonder what other problems this thing can solve?  Well, the screwdriver is not actually good at screwing in anything, but I wonder what  other problems it could solve." And then they go, "Maybe you can use it to  cook, maybe you can use it to clean." And it's like, no, the problem was,  I need to screw something in, the user was a mechanic, and if your screwdriver  doesn't help the mechanic solve their problem, keep the mechanic, keep the problem, I need  to screw something in, fix the fucking screwdriver.

所以如果它对某些用户不起作用，他们就会开始想，“好吧，我想知道这个东西还能解决什么问题？好吧，螺丝刀实际上并不擅长拧进任何东西，但我想知道它还能解决什么其他问题。”然后他们会说，“也许你可以用它做饭，也许你可以用它来清洁。”这就像，不，问题是，我需要拧一些东西，用户是一个机械师，如果你的螺丝刀不能帮助机械师解决他们的问题，保留机械师，保持问题，我需要拧一些东西，修好该死的螺丝刀。

That's the thing that's broken, right? The  broken thing is not the mechanic, and it's not the fact that they need to  screw something in.

这就是坏了的东西，对吧？坏掉的东西不是机械师，也不是他们需要拧进什么东西的事实。

So iterate, continue improving on your solution until it actually solves the  problem.

所以迭代，继续改进你的解决方案，直到它真正解决了问题。

In most cases, most people should be building a very lean MVP.

在大多数情况下，大多数人应该建立一个非常精简的MVP。

So by  that we mean, you should be able to build it fast in weeks, not months.

因此，我们的意思是，您应该能够在几周内快速构建它，而不是几个月。

 This can either involve software, or honestly, we see startups just start with a landing  page and a spreadsheet, but most startups can start very, very fast.

这可能涉及软件，或者老实说，我们看到初创公司只是从登录页面和电子表格开始，但大多数初创公司可以非常、非常快地开始。

The second extremely  limited functionality, you need to condense down what your user needs...

第二个极其有限的功能，你需要压缩你的用户需要什么…

What your initial user  needs to a very simple set of things.

您的初始用户需要的是一组非常简单的东西。

A lot of times founders want to  address all of their users problems, and all of their potential users, when in reality  they should just focus on a small set of initial users and their highest order  problems, and then ignore the rest until later.

很多时候，创始人想要解决他们所有的用户问题，以及所有的潜在用户，但实际上他们应该只关注一小部分初始用户和他们的最高级别问题，然后忽略其余的问题，直到以后。

You should have a vision of everyone,  you should have an MVP very small.

你应该对每个人都有远见，你应该有一个非常小的MVP。

All this is, is a base to iterate  from, that's it.

所有这些都是，是迭代的基础，就是这样。

It's just a starting point, it doesn't...

这只是个起点，不是.

It's not special in any  way, you just have to start.

这并不是什么特别的事情，你只需要开始就可以了。

And so, please make sure you don't feel like  your MVP is too special.

所以，请确保你不会觉得你的MVP太特别了。

Okay.

好吧。

Here is a classic example.

这是一个经典的例子。

This is one of  Airbnb's first landing pages in 2008, I believe.

我相信这是Airbnb在2008年的首批登陆页面之一。

One of the things that you might  be interested in about in Airbnb's first product, is that there were no payments.

你可能对Airbnb的第一个产品感兴趣的一件事是没有付款。

When  you found a place to stay on Airbnb, you had to exchange money with the  host in person.

当你在Airbnb上找到住处时，你必须亲自与房东换钱。

Needless to say, that was a pretty fucking big problem, but they  started without payments.

不用说，这是一个他妈的很大的问题，但他们开始没有付款。

No map view.

没有地图视图。

You know how when you search Airbnb you can  see where the house is in the city? You don't have that sorry.

你知道当你搜索Airbnb时，你可以看到房子在城市的什么地方吗？你没有那么抱歉。

And, the  person writing all the code made, was working part-time.

而且，编写所有代码的人都是兼职的。

Okay? So everyone tells these kind  of magical stories about how everything was perfect from the beginning, Airbnb, not perfect from  the beginning.

好吧?所以每个人都讲这种神奇的故事，关于每件事从一开始就是完美的，Airbnb，而不是从一开始就完美。

The next one, Twitch.

下一个，Twitch。

This was what Twitch looked like day one, not  very familiar.

这就是Twitch第一天的样子，不是很熟悉。

Well, maybe a little familiar.

嗯，也许有点熟悉。

There's some video there, and there's some chat  there, other than that, nothing else.

那里有一些视频，还有一些聊天，除此之外，没有其他东西。

Twitch launched as Justin.tv, which was an online reality  TV show.

Twitch以Justin.tv的形式推出，这是一个在线真人秀节目。

There was only one channel, Justin, you had to follow his life.

只有一个频道，贾斯汀，你必须追随他的生活。

If  you didn't like his life, you had to leave the website.

如果你不喜欢他的生活，你必须离开网站。

That's all there was.

就这么多了。

 The video was extremely low resolution.

视频的分辨率非常低。

It was funny, a founder asked me back in  the day like, "Oh, wasn't it weird you guys had video in your apartment? Weren't  there all these secret documents and things that people would be able to see?" And  I was like, "You could barely recognize our faces, let alone documents that we had."  And most importantly, there were no video games.

有趣的是，一位创始人在那天问我，“哦，你们的公寓里有视频，这不是很奇怪吗？难道不是所有这些秘密文件和东西都可以让人们看到吗？”我想，“你几乎认不出我们的脸，更不用说我们拥有的文件了。”最重要的是，没有电子游戏。

No video games, except if we decided  to play video games in our apartment.

没有电子游戏，除非我们决定在我们的公寓里玩电子游戏。

That was the only time video games appeared.

那是唯一次出现电子游戏。

 And so, I'm going to say you can do that quickly.

所以，我要说的是，你可以很快做到这一点。

When you think about  Twitch, it's much more complex now.

当你想到Twitch，它现在要复杂得多。

Last, Stripe, which wasn't Stripe, it was called /dev/payments,  because why not.

最后一条，条纹，它不是条纹，它被称为/dev/payments，因为为什么不。

Let's make a name that's really easy to remember.

让我们创造一个非常容易记住的名字。

This was Stripe  day one, no bank deals.

这是条纹的第一天，没有银行交易。

I won't tell you exactly how they processed payments, but  it was in a very startupy way.

我不会告诉你他们是如何处理付款的，但它是以一种非常初创的方式进行的。

Almost no features.

几乎没有特征。

And even cooler, if you  wanted to use Stripe, the Stripe founders would come to your office and integrate it  for you.

更酷的是，如果你想要使用条纹，条纹的创始人会来到你的办公室，并为你集成它。

How nice is that? Half because they were just desperate to get anyone  to use it, and half because it was a great way to find bugs before  the users found bugs, integrate it yourself.

多好啊？一半是因为他们只是不顾一切地让任何人使用它，另一半是因为它是在用户发现bug之前发现bug的一个很好的方法，自己集成它。

So these are just three examples of extremely  simple, extremely fast to build MVPs.

所以这只是三个非常简单，构建MVP非常快的例子。

All of these are a billion dollar companies, and  they all started with something that most people would say, is pretty shitty.

所有这些都是十亿美元的公司，它们都是从大多数人会说的东西开始的，相当糟糕。

In very  few cases you have to build a heavy MVP.

在极少数情况下，你必须建立一个沉重的MVP。

I just invented that term, heavy  MVP, when I made this presentation two days ago, so maybe it becomes a thing.

当我两天前做这个演讲的时候，我刚刚发明了这个术语，重型MVP，所以也许它会成为一种东西。

 If you're in an industry with significant regulation, like insurance, or banking, sometimes drones, although  sometimes not, it's hard to launch.

如果你在一个有重大监管的行业，比如保险或银行，有时也有无人机，虽然有时不是，但很难启动。

It's harder to launch.

更难发射。

You have to pass through  a bunch of regulatory bodies first.

你必须首先通过一堆监管机构。

I you're doing hard tech, if you're building rockets,  it is hard to build a rocket in a couple of weeks.

如果你在做硬技术，如果你在制造火箭，很难在几周内造出一枚火箭。

Biotech, it is  hard to invent a cancer drug in a couple of weeks.

生物技术，很难在几周内发明一种抗癌药物。

Moonshots, well fill in  all the other blanks, it's hard to bore tunnels in the earth and have extremely  fast vehicles that replace cars in a couple of weeks.

登月，很好地填补了所有其他的空白，很难在地球上钻隧道，而且在几周内就有了速度极快的车辆来取代汽车。

So, if you're in that  situation, please remember that your MVP can start with a simple, simple website that explains  what you do.

所以，如果你在这种情况下，请记住你的MVP可以从一个简单，简单的网站开始，解释你的工作。

It's helpful when you talk to people and you interact with people,  that they can refer back to something.

当你和人们交谈和互动时，他们可以参考一些东西，这是很有帮助的。

So that can be your start, and you  can build that simple website in days, not weeks.

所以这可以是你的开始，你可以在几天内建立这个简单的网站，而不是几周。

So in many ways maybe your  heavy MVPs are faster than your lean MVPs in some weird strange way.

所以在很多方面，也许你的重MVP比你的瘦MVP更快，在一些奇怪的方式。

Now, I  want to talk about launching for a second, because a lot of founders have this  misconception about launching.

现在，我想谈一下启动，因为很多创始人对启动有这种误解。

They see big companies launch stuff, and they assume that's what startups  do.

他们看到大公司推出东西，他们认为这就是初创公司所做的。

In fact, they see companies they kind of think about like startups.

事实上，他们认为自己认为的公司有点像初创公司。

Facebook is  not really a startup anymore, but they see them getting a lot of press, and  getting a lot of buzz, and yada, yada, yada, and they have in their head  that, that's what a successful company looks like when they launch.

Facebook不再是一家真正的初创公司，但他们看到他们得到了大量的新闻，得到了很多的评论，而且他们的头脑中有这样的想法，这就是一个成功的公司成立时的样子。

Well, let me ask  you this question, how many here remember the day that Google launched? No.

那么，让我问你一个问题，这里有多少人还记得谷歌推出的那一天？没有。

How about  Facebook? Okay.

Facebook怎么样？好吧。

How about Twitter? No.

Twitter怎么样？没有。

Great.

太棒了。

So it turns out, that launches aren't that  special at all, okay? So if you have this magical idea of your magical launch  you want to do, throw it away, it's not that special.

所以事实证明，发射并不是那么特别，好吗？所以，如果你对你的魔术发射有这个神奇的想法，你想要做的，扔掉它，它并不是那么特别。

The number one thing  that's really important, is to get some customers.

最重要的事情是获得一些客户。

So to make people feel better, let's  use different terms.

所以为了让人们感觉更好，让我们使用不同的术语。

How about launch, is when you get any customers? And how about  press launch, press launch, really impressive, is when people write about things and it's all  exciting, and you get all this buzz? Let's push the press launch off, and let's  push the, get any customers launch really, really soon.

当你有客户的时候推出怎么样？那么新闻发布呢，真的令人印象深刻，当人们写东西的时候，一切都很令人兴奋，而你得到了所有这些嗡嗡声？让我们推开媒体发布，让我们推动，让任何客户非常快地发布。

That's our goal here.

这就是我们的目标。

It's a  lot harder to learn from your customers when they don't have a product they can  play with.

当你的客户没有可以使用的产品时，要向他们学习要困难得多。

You can talk to your customer all day, but you have no idea  whether the thing you want to build can solve their problem.

您可以整天与客户交谈，但您不知道您想要构建的东西是否可以解决他们的问题。

If you put the  thing in front of them, and it doesn't solve their problem, you know right away.

如果你把事情摆在他们面前，而这不能解决他们的问题，你马上就知道了。

 And so, all the research in the world is good, but until you can put  something in front of people, you have no frigging idea whether it's going to work.

所以，世界上所有的研究都是好的，但是直到你能把一些东西摆在人们面前之前，你根本不知道它会不会奏效。

 So spending all that time on a pitch deck, is not as valuable as spending  your time building anything that you can give to a customer.

所以，花那么多时间在摊位上，并不像花时间构建任何你能提供给客户的东西那么有价值。

Finally, some hacks for  building an MVP extremely quickly.

最后，构建MVP的一些技巧非常快。

First, time box your spec.

首先，时间盒子你的规格。

So your spec is a  list of stuff you need to build before you launch, time box it.

所以你的规范是你在发布之前需要构建的东西的列表，时间盒它。

Say, "Okay,  what happens if I want to launch in three weeks? Okay, well, the only things  that can be on my spec, are things I can build in three weeks." That  makes your life a lot simpler, it allows you to remove all the features you  can't build in three weeks.

说，“好吧，如果我想在三周内发布，会发生什么呢？好吧，好吧，在我的规范中唯一可以做到的，就是我可以在三周内构建的东西。”这让你的生活变得简单了很多，它允许你删除所有你不能在三周内构建的功能。

Second, write your spec.

第二，写你的规范。

This seems really straight forward, but  most people fuck this one up.

这看起来真的很直截了当，但大多数人都他妈的把这个搞砸了。

It's really easy to change what you're working on  before you ever launch it, because you never write it down.

在发布之前改变你正在做的事情真的很容易，因为你从来不会写下来。

You start working on  something, you talk to a user, they say, "Oh, I would never use that." Or,  God forbid, you talk to a investor and they say, "Oh, that could never be  a company," because investors know everything, and so you decide to change what you're working  on.

你开始做某件事，你和一个用户交谈，他们说，“哦，我永远不会用那个。”或者，上帝不允许，你和一个投资者交谈，他们说，“哦，那永远不可能是一家公司，”因为投资者什么都知道，所以你决定改变你正在做的事情。

And because you never wrote it down, you don't even really realize you're changing  it.

因为你从来没有把它写下来，你甚至没有真正意识到你正在改变它。

And so, your three week plan turns into a three month plan.

因此，你的三周计划变成了三个月的计划。

If you  write shit down, at least you can be honest with yourself that you're changing your  spec all the time.

如果你写下狗屎，至少你可以诚实地告诉自己，你一直在改变你的规格。

The next one is, cut your spec.

下一个是，削减你的规格。

A week into your  kind of three week sprint, you probably realize that you added too many things to  your spec, and you're not going to make your deadline, that's okay, just cut the  stuff that clearly isn't important.

在你为期三周的冲刺一周后，你可能意识到你添加了太多的东西到你的规范中，而且你不会达到你的最后期限，没关系，只是削减那些明显不重要的东西。

And if there's no non-important things, start cutting important things.

如果没有不重要的东西，就开始削减重要的东西。

 Most of the goal here, is just to get anything out in the world.

这里的大多数目标，就是把世界上的任何东西都拿出来。

Once  you get anything out in the world, the momentum to keep anything going, is extremely  strong.

一旦你得到了世界上的任何东西，保持任何事物进行的动力都是极其强大的。

Once you have anything...

一旦你有了什么.。

If you don't have anything out in the world, it's  very easy to just delay, delay, delay.

如果你在这个世界上没有任何东西，很容易只是拖延，拖延。

And then last, don't fall in love with  your MVP.

最后，不要爱上你的MVP。

So many people fall in love with the vision in their head, and  none of the products I showed you before was the initial vision what it ended  up being.

如此多的人爱上了他们头脑中的愿景，而我之前向你们展示的任何产品都不是最初的愿景，它最终会是什么样子。

So please don't fall in love with your MVP, it's just step one  in a journey.

所以请不要爱上你的MVP，这只是旅途中的第一步。

You wouldn't fall in love with a paper you wrote in the  first grade, and that's the level of impact often your MVP has.

你不会爱上你在一年级时写的一篇论文，这就是你的MVP经常产生的影响。

Okay, that's the  talk, I have a little bit of time for questions.

好了，谈话结束了，我有一点时间提问。

Any questions? Perfect, no questions.
Speaker 2:I'm finding talking to users, I have several sub-type segments, and of course each one  wants a particular thing, and another one wants a particular thing.

有问题吗？很好，没有问题。演讲者2：我发现与用户交谈，我有几个子类型部分，当然每个人都想要一个特定的东西，另一个想要一个特定的东西。

So the numbers are  so small that they kind of even out, so how...

所以数字是如此之小，以至于他们有点均匀，所以怎么.

What-
Michael:Great question.

什么-迈克尔：好问题。

So you talk to users and they have all these things that you  want to build, and there isn't a lot of overlap between them? So I will  give you kind of the meta answer, never ask users for features.

所以你和用户交谈，他们有你想要构建的所有这些东西，而且他们之间没有太多的重叠？所以我会给你一种元答案，永远不要要求用户提供功能。

Never ask users  to tell you what they want.

永远不要让用户告诉你他们想要什么。

It's not the users job to come up with  features, that's your job.

提出特性不是用户的工作，那是你的工作。

The users job is to give you problems.

用户的工作是给你带来问题。

And so, I  would assume that if you're talking to these users, there's some continuity in the problems  that they have.

因此，我假设如果您与这些用户交谈，他们所遇到的问题会有一定的连续性。

They probably have no idea how to solve the problem, and so  they're probably giving you a long list of potential features they think can solve the  problem, as opposed to spending a lot of time just talking about what their problem  is, how often do they experience it, how intense is it, are they willing to  pay for a solution, do they know other people who have the problem.

他们可能不知道如何解决问题，所以他们可能会给你一长串他们认为可以解决问题的潜在功能，而不是花很多时间只谈论他们的问题是什么，他们经历的频率有多高，强度有多大，他们是否愿意为解决方案付费，他们是否认识其他有问题的人。

So those  are the questions that we're trying to get out of someone, and if you see  someone sneaking into a feature zone, like, "Oh, you know, I love Microsoft Word, but  I wish that someone could build something that lets me do, blah, blah, blah, blah,"  right, then you've got to scoot it back down to, "Oh, well why do you  want to do blah, blah, blah, blah? What problem do you have? How often do  you encounter that problem," and get it back to problem.

所以这些就是我们试图从某人那里得到的问题，如果你看到有人偷偷溜进一个功能区，比如，“哦，你知道，我喜欢Microsoft Word，但我希望有人能构建一些让我做的事情，”废话，“好吧，那么你必须把它拉回，”哦，那么你为什么要做废话？你有什么问题？你多久会遇到这个问题，“然后把它放回问题上。”。

That's how you avoid feature  death.

这就是你避免特写死亡的方法。

It's extremely common.

这是非常普遍的。

Yeah?
Speaker 3:I find myself walking that very thin line between staying focused on my MVP, but  changing it up because I'm finding one thing better.

嗯?演讲者3：我发现自己在专注于MVP和改变MVP之间走着一条很细的线，因为我发现有一件事更好了。

So I started off on my  MVP, talking to all my potential users, and I'm, "No, no, no, let me add  this, let me add this, we've got to add this." So do I take my  ADT medication and just keep going with what I started with, or when do you  stop and say, "Okay, this warrants a change?"
Michael:Oh, yes, sorry.

所以我开始使用我的MVP，和我所有的潜在用户交谈，我说，“不，让我添加这个，我们必须添加这个。”那么，我是否服用ADT药物并继续使用我开始使用的药物，或者什么时候停下来说，“好的，这需要改变？”迈克尔：哦，是的，对不起。

So the question is, I'm stuck in this cycle where I keep  on changing my MVP and I don't launch.

所以问题是，我被困在这个循环中，我一直在改变我的MVP，但我没有推出。

I see a lot of people who  are stuck in that cycle, and there are a lot of startup problems where the  answer is stop doing what you're doing.

我看到很多人被困在这个循环中，还有很多创业问题，答案就是停止做你正在做的事情。

Just stop it.

别说了。

You don't have to keep  on changing your MVP.

你不必一直改变你的MVP。

One of the reasons why perhaps you're changing your MVP, is  because you think it's special.

也许你改变MVP的原因之一是因为你认为它很特别。

If you didn't think it was special, you would stop  changing it, you'd stop editing it.
Speaker 3:I don't understand sir, explain that again.
Michael:If you think your MVP is special, you think it has to be perfect.

如果你不认为它特别，你会停止改变它，你会停止编辑它。扬声器3：我不明白，先生，再解释一遍。迈克尔：如果你认为你的MVP很特别，你认为它必须是完美的。

If  you think it has to be perfect, you spend a lot of time messing with  it.

如果你认为它必须是完美的，你就会花很多时间来弄乱它。

If you assume that it has to be really shitty, right...

如果你认为它必须真的很糟糕，对吧.

If you think,  "Okay, I'm literally trying to find a shirt in my closet that I can paint  with and then destroy," you don't spend a lot of time tailoring that shirt, right?  So if you think your MVPs less special, you'll spend less time tinkering with it.

如果你想，“好吧，我真的想在我的衣柜里找到一件衬衫，我可以用它来画，然后毁掉”，你不会花很多时间裁剪那件衬衫，对吧？因此，如果你认为你的MVP不那么特别，你就会花更少的时间来修修补补。

 Yeah.
Speaker 4:Say you launch your MVP and you're looking for feedback, what are the key things  you want to ask your [inaudible]?
Michael:This is a really simple question.

嗯。演讲者4：假设你启动了你的MVP，你正在寻求反馈，你想问你的[听不见]的关键问题是什么？迈克尔：这是一个非常简单的问题。

What's the key thing you want to learn when  you want to get feedback on your MVP? Does it solve the problem I wanted  to solve? That's it.

当你想得到关于MVP的反馈时，你想要学习的关键是什么？它能解决我想解决的问题吗？就这样。

You can find 80 different ways of answering that question, but  if you clearly understand the problem you're trying to solve, then it's a pretty clear...

你可以找到80种不同的方法来回答这个问题，但是如果你清楚地理解你试图解决的问题，那么它就非常清楚了…

 Often times you don't have to ask.

通常情况下你不需要问。

If it's in front of the user, you  can see whether they're doing the thing you want them to do, or whether they're  not.

如果它在用户面前，你可以看到他们是在做你想让他们做的事情，还是不是。

Often times you can see it in the numbers.

通常情况下，你可以在数字中看到它。

If it's a problem you  have every day and you introduce the user to it, did they come back the  next day? I've never really seen a product that solves a problem people have every  day, that actually solves the problem where a user just stops using it, because whatever.

如果这是你每天都遇到的问题，你把它介绍给用户，他们第二天会回来吗？我从未见过真正解决人们每天遇到的问题的产品，它实际上解决了用户停止使用它的问题，因为不管怎样。

 So there are lots of weird nuances here that are completely relevant.

所以这里有很多奇怪的细微差别是完全相关的。

Does the user  do the thing, solve the problem that you want them to solve? Other questions, in  the back there.
Speaker 5:How long should an MVP last? I mean, you start growing and then what the  next steps?
Michael:Do you know what's fun about startups? I don't like thinking about timelines, and I  don't like thinking about roadmaps.

用户是否做了事情，解决了你希望他们解决的问题？其他问题，在后面。演讲者5：MVP应该持续多长时间？我的意思是，你开始成长，然后下一步怎么办？迈克尔：你知道创业的乐趣是什么吗？我不喜欢思考时间表，也不喜欢思考路线图。

For people who are in the pre-MVP stage, who knows,  launch something, figure it out.

对于那些处于MVP预赛阶段的人，谁知道，发布一些东西，弄清楚它。

You decided to do a startup, and one of the  characteristics of startups is that, how to get from A to Z is not going  to be clear.

你决定做一家初创公司，而初创公司的特征之一就是，如何从A到Z是不清楚的。

And so, if you're too focused on, "Oh, well I understand getting  an MVP is step B, but I'm really focused on step C, D and E,"  I would tell you, like, "Hey, how about solving the problem right in front of  you first." Yeah?
Speaker 6:So how do you balance, for example, improving the MVP to grow the retention of  customers, versus betting on efforts to grow acquisition and lead generation in terms of problems?
Michael:Post MVP, should you work on growth or should you work on retention? I love  this question, it's the funnest question in the world, because it allows me to give  a ridiculously canned answer.

所以，如果你太专注于，“哦，好吧，我知道获得MVP是B步，但我真的专注于C，D和E步，”我会告诉你，就像，“嘿，先解决你面前的问题怎么样。”嗯?演讲者6：那么，您如何平衡，例如，改进MVP以增加客户的保留率，还是押注于在问题方面努力增加收购和领导生成？迈克尔：在MVP之后，你是应该致力于成长，还是应该致力于留住？我喜欢这个问题，这是世界上最有趣的问题，因为它允许我给出一个可笑的固定答案。

Both.

两者都有。

Yeah.

嗯。

Here's what happens, a lot of sort of founders  kind of fundamentally understand their startup is a Multi Variable Problem, but Multi Variable Problems  are hard, so they try to reduce it to a single variable.

事情是这样的，很多创业者从根本上理解他们的创业是一个多变量问题，但多变量问题很难，所以他们试图把它减少到一个变量。

So they ask  the secret advisor, "Oh, what's more important, growth or retention?" What's more important, taking a  shower or going to the bathroom and doing a number two? I'd like you to  do both.

所以他们问秘密顾问，“哦，哪个更重要，成长还是留住？”哪个更重要，洗澡还是去洗手间然后做第二件事？我希望你两样都做。

Sorry, both are important.

对不起，两者都很重要。

As a founder, you're going to have to juggle  multiple things.

作为一名创始人，你必须同时处理多件事情。

Yeah?
Speaker 7:Okay.

嗯?扬声器7：好的。

Let' me share a story with a startup that didn't talk to the end  users, with those end users won't talk about the problem, how do you overcome that,  do you know?
Michael:Let's be clear, the question is, how do you talk to your users if they  have a problem they don't want to talk about? Why don't you tell me what  that is.

让我和一个没有和最终用户交谈的创业公司分享一个故事，那些最终用户不会谈论这个问题，你知道如何克服这个问题吗？Michael：让我们澄清一下，问题是，如果你的用户有一个他们不想谈论的问题，你如何与他们交谈？你为什么不告诉我那是什么。

What's the problem?
Speaker 7:Type Two Diabetes.
Michael:Type Two Diabetes.

有什么问题吗？演讲者7：2型糖尿病。迈克尔：2型糖尿病。

I am perfectly confident that you can find 10 people who want  to talk about their Type Two Diabetes.

我非常有信心，你可以找到10个想要谈论他们的2型糖尿病的人。

And I question you starting a startup to  help Type Two Diabetes people if you don't know anyone who's got Type Two Diabetes  who's willing to talk to you.

如果你不知道有谁患有2型糖尿病，并且愿意和你交谈，我怀疑你是否启动了一家帮助2型糖尿病患者的初创公司。

So I think that's one of those false set  ups, I reject the premise of the question.

所以我认为这是一个错误的设置，我拒绝这个问题的前提。

All right, next question, go ahead.
Speaker 8:How many people would be enough to sign up, or how many active users would  be good to have in the MVP before presenting to investors for example, based on  which [inaudible] market size, or-
Michael:That's a great question.

好的，下一个问题，继续。演讲者8：多少人就足够注册，或者在向投资者展示之前，MVP中有多少活跃用户是好的，例如，根据(听不见的)市场规模，或者-迈克尔：这是一个很好的问题。

If I were to summarize it, I would say how far  along are you before you talk to investors.

如果要我总结一下，我会在你和投资者交谈之前说出你的年龄。

I'm also going plunt on that answer.

我也会对这个答案犹豫不决。

 I think there's going to be a whole lecture on when you should talk to  investors, and so I will say, wait for that lecture.

我认为会有一个完整的讲座，关于你应该何时与投资者交谈，所以我会说，等待那个讲座。

Whoever gives it, will do  a great job at answering that question.
Speaker 8:Okay, thank you.
Speaker 9:My question is, what type of numbers or attraction should you look for before your
Michael:I'll rephrase that question, how do you know when you have product market fit? Okay.

无论是谁给它，都会在回答这个问题方面做得很好。演讲者8：好的，谢谢。演讲者9：我的问题是，在你的演讲之前，你应该寻找什么类型的数字或吸引力？迈克尔：我会重新表述这个问题，你怎么知道什么时候你的产品适合市场？好吧。

 The classic answer, which is actually correct and founders really hate, is that, if you're  asking, you don't have product market fit.

经典的答案，实际上是正确的，创始人真的很讨厌，那就是，如果你问，你没有产品市场适合。

What tends to happen when you have product  market fit is that, people start using your product so much, you transition from doing  anything other than just keeping it online.

当你拥有适合产品市场的产品时，往往会发生这样的情况：人们开始大量使用你的产品，你不再做任何事情，而不仅仅是保持在线。

That's what product market fit tends to look  like.

这就是产品市场适合的样子。

So you stop thinking about new features, you stop thinking about improving your conversion  through funnels, you stop thinking about how to get better distribution, and you are literally  just like, "Holy shit, I don't know how I'm going to serve the people who  are coming to my product tomorrow.

所以你不再考虑新功能，你不再考虑通过漏斗提高你的转换，你不再考虑如何获得更好的分销，你真的就像是，“该死的，我不知道我将如何为明天来我的产品的人服务。

I'm at a loss.

我不知所措。

And next week, I'm at  a loss.

下周，我就不知所措了。

And I'm pretty sure that we're going die, because we have too many  users." And what's funny is, when I put it that way, it's not hard to  know whether you're there or not.

我很确定我们会死，因为我们的用户太多了。“有趣的是，当我这样说的时候，不难知道你是否在那里。

And there's such a horrible reality is that, almost  no-one gets product market fit.

而且有这样一个可怕的现实是，几乎没有人得到产品市场适合。

Almost no-one.

几乎没有人。

Almost no-one.

几乎没有人。

A lot of people like to  throw around the terms, and a lot of people like to redefine it as, someone's  using my product.

很多人喜欢随意使用术语，很多人喜欢将其重新定义为，有人在使用我的产品。

That's not the term.

不是这个词。

The term for someone's using your product is,  you have a user.

有人使用你的产品的术语是，你有一个用户。

That's good, but it's not product market fit.

这很好，但不适合产品市场。

In the back.
Speaker 10:The more users we talk to, the definition of the problem keeps on getting bigger,  and bigger, and bigger.

在后面。演讲者10：我们交谈的用户越多，问题的定义就越大，越大。

So when thinking of MVPs where do we [inaudible]? We started  working with just one user, and we tried to write a small experiment with them,  but while doing that we learned more attributes of the problem itself.
Michael:So what happens if you learn more about the problem and the problem expands as  you start interacting with users? That's totally fine, that's expected in fact.

那么，当我们想到MVP时，我们在哪里[听不见]？我们开始只与一个用户合作，我们试图与他们一起编写一个小实验，但在这样做的同时，我们了解到了问题本身的更多属性。Michael：那么，如果您了解有关问题的更多信息，并且问题随着您开始与用户交互而扩展，会发生什么呢？那完全没问题，事实上这是预料之中的。

What I would  say though is that, where founders usually make the mistake, is they think they have  to solve the problem for all users.

但我想说的是，创始人通常会犯错误，他们认为他们必须为所有用户解决问题。

And so, most importantly, if you have one  user with a set of problems, a nice thing to do would be to try  to figure out is there anyone else like them.

因此，最重要的是，如果你有一个用户遇到了一系列问题，一件很好的事情就是尝试找出是否还有其他人像他们一样。

And one fun thing you could  do, is just ask them, "Hey, do you know anyone else whose got your exact  same problem?" Any problem, when you kind of scoop back and you think about the  vision of any founder, it actually encompasses a whole sub-set of problems.

你可以做的一件有趣的事情就是问他们，“嘿，你知道还有谁有和你完全一样的问题吗？”任何问题，当你想一想任何创始人的愿景时，它实际上包含了一个完整的问题子集。

And I think  the thing that gets people really screwed up with their MVP, is that they have  a vision that's big and they're not willing to have an MVP that's small.

我认为让人们真正搞砸MVP的事情是，他们有一个宏伟的愿景，而他们不愿意拥有一个小的MVP。

They  feel as though if they're not addressing all of the potential users up front, then  they're somehow failing.

他们感觉好像没有提前解决所有的潜在用户，那么他们不知何故失败了。

And there are a lot of things that a startup has to  do, or a founder has to do, where they're keeping two things in mind at  the same time, right? Vision big, MVP small, right? Grow and retain.

而且有很多事情是初创公司必须做的，或者创始人必须做的，他们同时记住了两件事，对不对？愿景大，MVP小，对吧？成长和留住。

One thing we  talk about at YC a lot, your investor pitch and your customer pitch, very different.

有一件事我们在YC谈论得很多，你的投资者推介和你的客户推介，非常不同。

 And founders always want to smoosh these things together, or kill one, because it's so  much easier to think of it as a single problem...

创始人总是想把这些东西亲吻在一起，或者扼杀其中的一个，因为它更容易被认为是一个单一的问题…。

A single thing in your  head versus two opposing things in your head.

你头脑中的一件事与你头脑中的两件相反的事情。

How could it be true that we  want to do payments for everyone, and have a little API that's so hard to  use that we have to install it for people, right? And it's like both things  are true, and you have to be comfortable with that.

我们想要为每个人做支付，并且有一个很难使用的API，所以我们必须为人们安装它，这怎么可能是真的呢，对吗？就像这两件事都是真的，你必须对此感到舒服。

All right, one more.

好了，再来一个。

Yeah?
Speaker 11:In the pharmaceutical space, would my users be other scientists or would they actually be  patients?
Michael:In the pharmaceutical space, who are your users? I think that, that's a question for  you.

嗯?演讲者11：在制药领域，我的用户是其他科学家还是实际上是患者？迈克尔：在制药领域，你的用户是谁？我认为，这是你的一个问题。

You are starting the company, you know what you're building, you know the problem  you're solving, you know who has the problem, I don't know any of those things.

你正在创办公司，你知道你在建设什么，你知道你正在解决的问题，你知道谁有问题，我不知道这些事情。

 All right.

好的。

It was great talking to all of you, thank you very much.


很高兴和你们所有人交谈，非常感谢。
