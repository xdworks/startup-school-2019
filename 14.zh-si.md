# Kevin Hale - How to Work Together

Kevin Hale:These are some guys I saw in Kyoto and they're tearing down a scaffolding and  I just think they're...

凯文·黑尔：这些是我在京都看到的一些人，他们正在拆除脚手架，我只是觉得他们…

Amazingly poetic and how they do their work.

令人惊讶的诗意和他们如何做他们的工作。

So in a  startup founders basically have to figure out how to optimize for a relationship that lasts  for like 10 years.

因此，在一家初创企业中，创始人基本上必须想出如何优化一段持续约10年的关系。

And that's a crazy thing to do with someone you might  only know for a couple of months or have only known and it's sort of  work setting.

和一个你可能只认识几个月或者只认识几个月的人一起做这是一件疯狂的事情，这是一种工作环境。

And the thing is like the only models for understanding that kind of  relationship actually come probably from our parents.

事情就像是理解这种关系的唯一模式可能来自我们的父母。

And so I'd like to start off with  some marriage research.

所以我想从一些婚姻研究开始。

So this is John Gottman, he studied marriages in Seattle.

这是John Gottman，他在西雅图研究婚姻。

He's been  featured in this American Life and a bunch of different places and basically he has  a cool magic trick.

他在“美国生活”和一大堆不同的地方都有特色，基本上他有一个很酷的魔术。

He can watch a couple fight about something for 15 minutes  and predict with 85% accuracy whether they'll be divorced or not four years from now.

他可以观看一对夫妇为某事争吵15分钟，并以85%的准确率预测他们四年后是否会离婚。

 If he watches them for an hour and have them also share their hopes and  dreams.

如果他观察他们一个小时，让他们也分享他们的希望和梦想。

His prediction rating goes up to 94%.

他的预测评分上升到94%。

And so this is the same videos  they would show two priests, psychologists, psychiatrists, marriage counselors, successfully married couples.

所以这就是他们展示给两位牧师，心理学家，精神病学家，婚姻顾问，成功结婚的夫妇的视频。

And they don't  predict better than random chance.

而且他们没有比随机机会更好的预测。

And so John Gottman he's figured something up.

所以约翰·戈特曼他想出了一些办法。

There's something  about the way we will have an argument that determines longevity.

有一些关于我们将有一个决定长寿的争论的方式。

And one of the  most surprising things that he discovered was that it's not that successfully married people who  will last a long time that they never fight.

而他发现的最令人惊讶的事情之一是，成功结婚的人并不是永远不会吵架的，他们会持续很长一段时间。

It turns out everybody in fights.

原来每个人都在打架。

 And we all fight about the exact same things, money, kids, sex, time, jealousy, and  the in-laws.

我们都为同样的事情而争吵，钱，孩子，性，时间，嫉妒和姻亲。

And time is usually what are we going to do with our free  time? And the thing that's interesting is like, I think all of these map out  to this stuff that we're going to fight about in a company.

而时间通常是我们要用我们的空闲时间做什么？有趣的是，我认为所有这些都映射到了我们在公司里将要争斗的这些东西。

And so you  with your co-founders are going to have these issues.

所以你和你的联合创始人将会有这些问题。

And the thing is what's nice  about knowing everyone fights and that you know what you're going to fight about is  that we can make a plan for figuring out how to deal with this one  situation that will determine whether we will work together on the thing that we're so  passionate about down the road.

问题是，知道每个人都在战斗是件好事，你知道你将为什么而战斗，这就是我们可以制定一个计划来解决这一问题，这将决定我们是否会在未来的道路上共同努力，我们对这件事充满了热情。

The other thing that John got me figured out is  that there's four major things we want to avoid when we're fighting, and when we  do these things they will create sort of leading indicators that the relationship is in  serious trouble.

约翰让我明白的另一件事是，当我们吵架的时候，我们要避免四件主要的事情，当我们做这些事情的时候，他们会创造出一种领先的指标，表明我们的关系陷入了严重的麻烦。

I'm going to go through each one of these.

我要逐一看一遍。

So criticism, this is  basically like you're talking with someone and you're like, "Hey you know what? I have  a serious concern about this bug that we are trying to fix and I'm really  worried about this thing and I'm not sure that we're going to be able to  deploy on time." And someone comes up and says like, "Well, you know, what I  don't like? Is the fact that you leave a bunch of dirty dishes in the  sink." And criticism is basically this idea that we don't fight on one topic, we  start trying to bring all these other issues into play instead of addressing the one  issue at hand.

所以批评，这基本上就像你在和某人交谈，你会说，“嘿，你知道吗？我对我们试图修复的这个漏洞非常担心，我真的很担心这个东西，我不确定我们是否能够按时部署。”然后有人走过来说，“好吧，你知道，我不喜欢什么？就是你把一堆脏盘子留在水槽里。”而批评基本上是这样的想法，我们不是在一个问题上斗争，我们开始尝试把所有这些其他问题发挥作用，而不是解决手头的一个问题。

Dangerous.

危险。

Contempt is a pretty easy one.

藐视是一件很容易的事。

It's intention to insult.

这是故意侮辱。

So  basically I say like, "Hey, I'm worried about this bug and we're not going to  be able to deploy on time" And someone says, "Oh, I don't like your face."  That's contempt.

所以基本上我说，“嘿，我担心这个bug，我们不能按时部署”，有人说，“哦，我不喜欢你的脸。”这是蔑视。

And what you want to avoid is making things personal.

而你想避免的是让事情变得个人化。

So run a  business.

那就去做生意吧。

This one's kind of easy to understand is that someone not owning responsibility about  the problem.

这个很容易理解的是，有人对这个问题没有责任。

And so we can't move forward because someone won't admit that there's a  problem out there.

所以我们不能前进，因为有人不会承认存在问题。

We defend that we haven't done anything wrong and therefore there can't  be resolution between two people if the other person thinks there's a problem.

我们辩解说，我们没有做错任何事，因此如果另一个人认为有问题，那么两个人之间就不可能有解决方案。

This one  is a super dangerous one.

这是一个超级危险的。

And it's when basically you're like, "Hey, I got a  problem and the person just walks away." Won't engage, won't talk to you.

当你基本上是这样的时候，“嘿，我遇到了一个问题，那个人就这么走开了。”不会参与也不会跟你说话。

And so  there can be no way to create any kind of resolution.

因此没有办法创建任何类型的解决方案。

So just as you  wouldn't do this without doing some of this, we want to make a plan and  I'm going to talk about four different things that we can do that helps avoid  and protect us from those four horsemen.

所以就像你不做这些就不会做这些一样，我们想要制定一个计划，我要谈谈我们可以做的四个不同的事情，帮助我们避免和保护我们免受那四个骑士的伤害。

The first one is divide and conquer.

第一个是分而治之。

And  this feels pretty straight forward, but you want to do this early in the relationship  with your co-founders and in the early stages of your company.

这感觉非常直截了当，但你希望在与联合创始人的关系早期以及公司的早期阶段就这样做。

So here's our list  again of the types of things that we might have problems with.

所以这里再次列出了我们可能遇到的问题的类型。

And in the  early stages of the startup, let's say [Adora] and I are doing a startup together,  just her and me.

在创业的早期阶段，假设[Adora]和我一起创业，只有她和我。

Then what you want to do is just kind of say  like, "Oh, who's responsible, what stuff?" And what this will do is like, if there's  a problem in that category, then that person that we have assigned to ahead of  time to be in charge, we'll be the ones that will ultimately either make the  decision or ultimately are responsible.

然后你想要做的就是说，“哦，谁负责，什么东西？”这将是这样的，如果这个类别中有问题，那么我们提前分配给负责的那个人，我们将是最终做出决定或最终承担责任的人。

This protects us from defensiveness.

这可以保护我们不受防御。

So notice that you're on  jealousy.

所以请注意你是在嫉妒。

This is about competition usually.

这通常是关于竞争的。

And so usually in the early stages of your  start up, you should not be worried about competition.

因此，通常在创业的早期阶段，你不应该担心竞争。

Competition is not usually what kills  you in the very early stages of your company.

在公司的早期阶段，竞争通常不会扼杀你。

As your company ages.

随着公司的发展。

It might  change and look something like this...

它可能会改变看起来像这样.。

You'll sign things at different sort of positions and  heads.

你会在不同的位置和头上签字。

And as a result then when there's problems come up, you know, basically that  sort of is delegated.

结果，当出现问题时，你知道，基本上是委派的。

Now what happens...

现在发生了什么.。

If things go out of hand, even up  at those sort of levels.

如果事情失控，即使是在这种水平上。

Well basically what you want to do is decide after  you delegate who has ownership, determine what is success and failure.

那么基本上你想要做的就是在你授权之后决定谁拥有所有权，决定什么是成功和失败。

You want to know  also ahead of time, "Hey, we've divided up the tasks." But we also want to  know is like, "Hey, when is there going to be interference with the person that  is supposed to be leading these decisions?" What is considered like it's success enough that  we shouldn't be interfering and just let them do what they think is best and  what is considered really bad so that we have to enter fear and something has  to be done about it.

你还想提前知道，“嘿，我们已经把任务分开了。”但我们也想知道的是，“嘿，什么时候才会干预那些应该领导这些决定的人呢？”什么被认为是足够成功的，我们不应该干预，让他们做他们认为最好的和被认为非常糟糕的事情，这样我们就必须进入恐惧，并且必须对此采取一些措施。

So in this case, good examples would be like, "Hey,  if we've successfully fundraise, like we don't need to talk or like replace the person  that's responsible for that.

所以在这种情况下，很好的例子是，“嘿，如果我们成功地筹集了资金，就像我们不需要交谈或者更换负责的人一样。

If we're shipping on time, if we're rated top three amongst  the our sort of peers or we've built a referral program that's working, hey, we  don't need to be criticizing the person that's working on the stuff or they're doing  a good job.

如果我们按时发货，如果我们被评为同类同行中的前三名，或者我们已经建立了一个有效的推荐程序，嘿，我们不需要批评正在处理这些东西的人，或者他们做得很好。

On the corollary.

根据推论。

We want to define, hey, what are the things  that basically are going to trigger conversations? Really hard conversations like, "Hey, if we hit  this sort of area, we need to put the brakes on and we need to  discuss what's going on and actually try to resolve these problems." A lot of people  like to delegate stuff, but they don't have a way of saying, "Hey, when are  we going to have a conversation about this? When there's trouble?" And these are really,  really easy to do.

我们想定义，嘿，基本上会引发对话的东西是什么？非常艰难的对话，比如，“嘿，如果我们碰到这种区域，我们需要踩刹车，我们需要讨论发生了什么，并实际尝试解决这些问题。”很多人喜欢把事情委派出去，但他们没有办法说，“嘿，我们什么时候谈这个？有麻烦的时候吗？”这些都是非常容易做到的。

And the reason you want to do these early while you're  sober emotionally sober is because once you get angry and emotions come into play, then  you might not be thinking rationally.

你想在清醒的时候尽早做这些事情的原因是，一旦你变得愤怒，情绪开始发挥作用，那么你可能就没有理性地思考了。

Now ultimately in the end, usually it's the CEO  and the company who has final say.

现在归根结底，通常是CEO和公司拥有最终发言权。

Now you as a team can decide differently  how you want to resolve it if you'd just, if you divvy up the stuff.

现在你们作为一个团队可以不同地决定你们想要如何解决它，如果你只是，如果你分配这些东西的话。

 But ultimately whoever's the CEO usually is one who resolves it.

但归根结底，无论谁是首席执行官，通常都是解决这个问题的人。

And if there's problems  with the CEO, then it's the board.

如果CEO有问题，那就是董事会。

And early stages of the startup the board  is usually composed of just the founders.

在初创企业的早期阶段，董事会通常只由创始人组成。

So you have to ultimately work it out.

所以你必须最终解决它。

 The second defense against the horsemen is knowing yourself.

对付骑手的第二道防线是了解自己。

This will protect you from stonewalling.

这会保护你不受阻碍。

 And when I mean is what is your attachment style? So there was all this  research that was done in the 1960s about how people approach relationships.

我的意思是你的依恋风格是什么？所以，所有这些研究都是在20世纪60年代进行的，关于人们如何处理关系。

And basically it  was determined that there's sort of three major types.

基本上确定了有三种主要类型。

There's a secure attachment style, and  that means basically it's like, "Hey, you know what? I don't have a problem going  up to people, relying on them and having them rely on me and sort of  like us creating a relationship.

有一种安全的依恋方式，这意味着基本上就像，“嘿，你知道吗？我没有问题去接近人们，依赖他们，让他们依赖我，有点像我们建立关系。

I don't mind being vulnerable and I don't mind other  people being vulnerable with me." That's called a secure attachment style.

我不介意变得脆弱，我也不介意其他人和我一起变得脆弱。“这就是所谓的安全依恋风格。

There's an anxious style.

有一种焦虑的风格。

 So there is a type of person that will be like, "You know what? I  kind of don't get enough love as not as much as I want.

所以有一种类型的人会说，“你知道吗？我没有得到足够的爱，没有我想要的那么多。”

I kind  of want to like hold on to people and I kind of want to have  people [inaudible] confirm with me that they want to be with me.

我有点想留住人们，我有点想让人们[听不见]跟我确认他们想和我在一起。

I feel like  it's a little difficult." And then there's another point kind of person who's like, "I  find it kind of difficult creating relationships with people and I kind of want to  run away sometimes because it's really scary." Or, "I'm worried that I'm going to mess  it up?" And the thing that's super important here, especially with your co-founder is you  want to know your co-founders attachment style because that's going to dictate how you are  going to be able to resolve and understand your differences.

我觉得这有点困难。“然后还有另一种人会说，”我发现与人建立关系有点困难，有时我会想逃跑，因为这真的很可怕。“或者，”我担心我会把事情搞砸？“这里非常重要的一点是，特别是对你的联合创始人来说，你想了解你的联合创始人的依恋风格，因为这将决定你如何解决和理解你的分歧。

Now what, it turns out  oddly enough is that an anxious attachment person and an avoidant attachment person, these are  the two most common in the world.

现在，奇怪的是，焦虑依恋的人和逃避的依恋的人，这是世界上最常见的两个人。

There's not that many like well-developed secure people  out there.

没有那么多像发展良好的安全的人在那里。

They tend to want to be with one another.

他们倾向于想和对方在一起。

So the person that  wants to run away and the person that wants to cling until you have is  someone who needs space to make a decision and to process problems, intention and the  someone who needs validation constantly, the process conflict and issues.

因此，想要逃跑的人和想要坚持到你拥有的人是那些需要空间来做出决定和处理问题的人，意图和需要不断验证的人，过程冲突和问题。

And so when those two  people are together and they don't realize what the other person needs, they don't realize  that they're going to have to bend to sort of make it work.

所以当这两个人在一起的时候，他们没有意识到另一个人需要什么，他们没有意识到他们必须弯下腰才能让它起作用。

There's lots  of good books on attachment styles has a wonderful Wikipedia page that covers it.

有很多关于附件风格的好书，有一个很棒的维基百科页面覆盖了它。

I  would recommend watching this youtube video that's from a School Of Life.

我推荐观看这段来自生活学校的YouTube视频。

And what I  would highly recommend is basically understanding that like if you're with someone that is of  the opposite type, that you're going to have to do work either to reach across  the aisle.

我强烈建议的是，基本上理解一下，如果你和另一个人在一起，你就必须做一些工作，才能到达过道的另一端。我强烈推荐的是，如果你和另一个人在一起，那么你就必须做一些工作，才能跨越过道。

Like if you're an anxious person, and you're talking to an avoidant person,  you just have to realize like, oh, that person's needs space.

就像你是一个焦虑的人，你正在和一个逃避的人说话，你只需要意识到，哦，那个人需要空间。

But that doesn't mean  they're running away from you.

但这并不意味着他们要逃离你。

And if you're an avoidant person and you're with an  anxious person that if someone needs your attention or if you need your space, then  you have to let them know as like, "Hey, I'm going to be back.

如果你是一个逃避的人，你和一个焦虑的人在一起，如果有人需要你的关注，或者如果你需要你的空间，那么你必须让他们知道，“嘿，我会回来的。

I  realized that you're going to need an answer for this.

我意识到你需要一个答案

I'm going to go away.

我要走了。

 I'm going to figure stuff out.

我会把事情弄清楚的。

And I promise a time that we will deal  with this.

我保证我们一定会处理好这件事。

Documented process, so this will protect you from criticism.

文档化的过程，因此这将保护您免受批评。

And so basically when  you're emotionally sober, it's the best time to create a process for dealing with disagreements.

所以基本上当你情绪清醒的时候，这是建立一个处理分歧的过程的最好时机。

 And the reason you want to do this is because once you're upset and angry  and filled with emotions, you are not going to be thinking straight.

你想这么做的原因是，一旦你心烦意乱，愤怒，充满了情感，你就不会想清楚了。

And so the  odds are you might say something you regret, you might say something that you don't  mean and the other person might do so and then you will have a much  different problem than the bug not being fixed and deployed on time.

所以很有可能你会说一些你后悔的话，你可能会说一些你不是真心的话，而另一个人可能会这样做，然后你会遇到一个非常不同的问题，而不是这个错误没有被及时修复和部署。

So one of  my favorite examples of this comes from the company called [Matter].

因此，我最喜欢的例子之一就是来自一家名为[Matter]的公司。

And they created a  spreadsheet for dealing with disagreements.

他们还创建了一个电子表格来处理分歧。

Basically it's a disagreement, decision framework and basically it just  talks about, it's like, "hey, when we have a disagreement we should just document it.

基本上，这是一个分歧，决策框架，基本上它只是谈论，就像，“嘿，当我们有分歧的时候，我们应该记录下来。

 This helps.

这有帮助。

Makes things really, really transparent.

让事情变得非常透明。

Makes us understand both sides very, very clearly.

让我们非常清楚地了解双方。

 We'll talk about the different options we say who makes the decision, what the decision  was, the date it was done and then rationale and so when we walk through  this process, if we've decided this ahead of time, then it means that we are  not afraid when disagreements come up.

我们将讨论不同的选择，我们说谁做决定，决定是什么，完成的日期，然后是理论基础，所以当我们走过这个过程时，如果我们提前决定了，那么这意味着当出现分歧时我们不会害怕。

It's like, "Oh, we have a process for dealing  with this and we will figure it out by filling out excel." There's lots of  different ways to do this.

就像，“哦，我们有一个处理这个问题的流程，我们会通过填写excel来解决它。”有很多不同的方法可以做到这一点。

You don't have to follow their sort of very specific  framework.

你不必遵循他们那种非常具体的框架。

They have lots of really great justifications in their article.

他们在文章中有很多非常好的理由。

You just have to  agree ahead of time what you want to do so therefore when you are upset  you just go, "Okay, great.

你只需要提前同意你想做什么，所以当你不高兴的时候，你就会说，“好的，太好了。

We have a process for this.

我们对此有一个流程。

And it process says,  "Oh, it says go have a time out or eat a bologna sandwich or like  take a nap first and then we'll figure out what we have to do.

它的过程说，“哦，它说去休息一下，或者吃个腊肠三明治，或者先打个盹，然后我们会想出我们要做的事情。”。

It  could be a process where it's like, "Hey, if there's a real disagreement and both  sides feel equally strong, we will flip a coin and then that will be the  decision for the test of time.

这可能是一个过程，就像，“嘿，如果真的有分歧，双方都感到同样强大，我们会抛硬币，然后这将是时间的考验的决定。”

We will let lady luck decide." It doesn't matter.

我们会让幸运女神来决定。“这无关紧要。

 You just have to both agree.

你只需要两个人都同意。

This strategy will protect you from contempt.

这个策略会保护你不受轻视。

So the  way that you avoid making things personal is you have to figure out way of  communicating with another in a way that will not be threatening.

所以，避免让事情个人化的方法是，你必须想办法以一种不会构成威胁的方式与他人沟通。

There's an amazing book  on this.

关于这方面有一本很棒的书。

It's called Nonviolent Communication by Marshall Rosenberg and it helps you be honest  with other people without criticizing, without insulting and without putting down other people.

它被马歇尔·罗森伯格称为非暴力交流，它帮助你与他人坦诚相待，不批评，不侮辱，不贬低别人。

And the  magic that comes in the structure that feels somewhat fake for people who are not  into being touchy feely.

对于那些不喜欢敏感的人来说，这个结构中的魔力让人感觉有点虚伪。

Basically when you're giving some kind of criticism, you want to  basically have it in this format.

基本上，当你提出某种批评时，你希望基本上是这样的格式。

So when some observation, I feel an emotion because  I'm needing some universal need, would you be able to request? So we're just going  to break down each one of these different parts and they're all...

所以当一些观察的时候，我感觉到一种情绪，因为我需要一些普遍的需要，你能请求吗？所以我们要分解每个不同的部分，它们都是.

Every single one  of these are tricky and it's a thing that a lot of people will try  to do and you'll spend your whole life trying to get really good at and  it's really difficult.

其中的每一个都是棘手的，这是一件很多人都会尝试去做的事情，你将花费你的一生去努力做到真正擅长，这真的很难。

So the first one is you need to make an observation versus  having an evaluation.

所以第一个问题是，你需要进行观察，而不是进行评估。

So basically what you want to do is start your disagreement or  criticism by anchoring the something that is concrete.

所以基本上你想要做的就是通过锚定具体的东西来开始你的分歧或批评。

You do not want it to be  something that is connected to opinion.

你不希望它是与意见有关的东西。

It should be something that you actually saw or  heard because therefore you can't disagree with something that actually happen versus something I heard  via rumor or something that has to do something that seems emotional or something that  seems like an opinion.

它应该是你实际看到或听到的东西，因为因此你不能不同意一些实际发生的事情，而不是我通过谣言听到的一些事情，或者必须做一些看起来很情绪化的事情，或者一些看起来像是观点的事情。

So I'll give you an example.

所以我给你举个例子。

An observation would be like,  "You said that you'd send that document last week and I haven't received it." All  right.

一个观察将会是这样的，“你说你会在上周发送那份文件，但我还没有收到它。”好吧。

So that is a great observation.

这是一个很好的观察。

Evaluation that someone might say instead in the  heat of the mon is that, "You're fucking lazy." That kind of feels like an  observation, but it's not.

在火热的MON中，有人可能会说的评价是，“你他妈的懒惰。”这感觉像是一种观察，但它不是。

It's evaluating the person.

它在评估这个人。

Give you another example.

再给你举个例子。

Your work is  sloppy.

你的工作太草率了。

That is not objective.

这是不客观的。

Instead, "Hey, three of the numbers in this report were  inaccurate." That's where you want to start.

相反，“嘿，这份报告中有三个数字是不准确的。”这就是你想要开始的地方。

"You're always late." You want to be really  careful because that's a generalization.

“你总是迟到”你要非常小心，因为这是一个概括。

It's an evaluation.

这是个评估。

Observation.

观察。

"Hey, you arrived 10 minutes late  to the meeting this morning." Evaluation, "You ignored me." Observation, "I sent you two emails  and I haven't received a response." Notice when we start with observation, we start with  a fact that can't be refuted and so we're not going to end up arguing  about something else.

“嘿，你今天早上开会迟到了10分钟。”评估，“你无视我”观察，“我给你发了两封电子邮件，但还没有收到回复。”请注意，当我们开始观察时，我们从一个无法反驳的事实开始，所以我们不会结束对其他事情的争论。

Notice all those other evaluations.

注意所有其他的评估。

They immediately will trigger an emotion in  you and that's why you want to be really careful.

它们会立即在你体内引发一种情绪，这就是为什么你要非常小心的原因。

Then we need to start  this criticism that you don't start with one of those.

然后我们需要开始这种批评，你不是从这些开始的。

The next is we have  to talk about our emotions.

下一步就是我们要谈谈我们的情感。

So I saw this irrefutable observation and it made me  feel something.

所以我看到了这个无可辩驳的观察，它让我有了一些感觉。

And what we have to be really careful of is not saying thoughts,  but instead talking about feelings, which is kind of odd, but it's connected to the  next point in the structure.

我们必须非常小心的不是说出想法，而是谈论感觉，这有点奇怪，但它与结构中的下一个点相关联。

So an emotion will be, I feel frustrated.

所以一种情绪会让我感到沮丧。

Now a  thought would be, and it could be put in the same structure.

现在一个想法会是，它可以被放在相同的结构中。

It's like, I  feel that you aren't taking this seriously.

就像，我觉得你没有认真对待这件事。

And the way you can tell if something  is a thought or a feeling is you substitute the phrase I think with I  feel and it still works.

你能分辨出某件事是一种想法还是一种感觉的方式是，你用我的感觉代替短语“我觉得”，它仍然有效。

So I think frustrated.

所以我觉得很沮丧。

Doesn't work so that's a feeling.

不起作用所以这是一种感觉。

 I think that you aren't taking this seriously.

我认为你没有认真对待这件事。

Oh, that's a thought.

哦，这是个想法。

There was a  couple of emotions that we have to be particularly careful of.

有几种情绪我们必须特别小心。

One is anger, because  anger is usually tied to a bunch of hosts of other things.

一种是愤怒，因为愤怒通常与一大堆其他事情联系在一起。

So when someone  says that I feel angry you or you realizing that you feel angry, you want  to be really, really specific about what's causing the anger, what's triggering it.

所以，当有人说我对你感到愤怒，或者你意识到你感到愤怒时，你想要非常具体地说明是什么导致了愤怒，是什么触发了愤怒。

The other  tricky emotions are evaluative emotions.

其他棘手的情绪是评价性情绪。

And usually what you need to figure out is what  underlines that evaluation.

通常情况下，你需要弄清楚的是，这种评估的重点是什么。

So I'll give you an example.

所以我给你举个例子。

So I feel blamed, right? Someone  else's evaluating me, I feel blamed.

所以我觉得被责备了，对吧？别人在评价我，我觉得受到了责备。

The impact actually is I feel scared.

影响其实是我感到害怕。

Someone is  blaming me and so I feel scared.

有人在责备我，所以我感到害怕。

So it takes a lot of work to  understand that when someone is giving me some...

所以要花很多功夫才能明白当有人给我一些.

If I'm feeling like some kind of  judging feeling, what does that the core root of it? Other examples are, I feel  judged.

如果我感觉像是一种评判的感觉，那它的核心根源是什么？其他的例子是，我觉得受到了评判。

The actual impact is I feel resentful.

真正的影响是我感到怨恨。

I feel misunderstood.

我觉得被误解了。

The impactful statement is  actually I feel frustrated.

影响深远的声明实际上是我感到沮丧。

I feel rejected.

我觉得被拒绝了。

The real impact is I feel hurt.

真正的冲击是我感到受伤。

It's  super hard.

太难了。

It's super, super hard.

超级，超级难。

I'm going to have a link inside of this  presentation to a pdf.

我将在这个演示文稿中有一个到pdf的链接。

It's three pages of evaluate of emotions, impacted feelings you probably  actually are feeling and then connects us to a universal need that you need to  overcome it, which leads us to our next thing.

这是三页对情绪的评估，你可能真正感受到的受影响的感觉，然后将我们连接到你需要克服的普遍需求，这将我们引向下一件事。

Every negative emotion lies and unmet  universal need.

所有的负面情绪都是谎言和未满足的普遍需求。

And so what that means is that like when you're feeling one of  these frustrated or blamed or scared or hurt feelings, there's something that's missing that you're  going to need.

所以这意味着，当你感到沮丧、责备、害怕或受伤的感觉时，你会缺少一些你需要的东西。

And the thing that's really tricky about universal needs that you have  to be careful realizing is it a strategy or is it a need? And is  it truly universal? So I'll give you an example.

关于普遍需求，真正棘手的是，你必须小心，意识到它是一种战略还是一种需要？它真的是普遍的吗？所以我给你举个例子。

You might be able to say,  "I need a sandwich." That is not a universal need.

你可能会说，“我需要一个三明治。”这不是普遍的需要。

So you have to be  really careful.

所以你必须非常小心。

And then you might say like, "I need a sandwich to give me  nourishment." That's more like a strategy.

然后你可能会说，“我需要一个三明治来给我营养。”这更像是一种策略。

A much better way might be, let me see  here.

更好的方法可能是，让我看看。

You might say something like, "I need you to copy me on every single  email." But the thing is that's not a universal need.

你可能会说，“我需要你在每一封电子邮件上都抄写我。”但问题是这并不是一个普遍的需求。

That becomes very, very specific.

变得非常具体。

 A universal need would be, I need some transparency about this process.

一个普遍的需要是，我需要这个过程的一些透明度。

You have to  be careful of not making needs about something that's very specific to yourself or just  that situation.

你必须小心不要对特定于你自己或仅仅是那种情况的东西提出要求。

Because once it's a universal need, then it's something that everyone can agree  that everyone should sort of have.

因为一旦它成为一种普遍的需求，那么它就是每个人都可以同意的，每个人都应该拥有的东西。

So other universal needs are like I need support.

所以其他普遍的需求就像我需要支持一样。

 And the way you turn it not into universal need is by saying something like,  "I need support from you." It's not everyone needs support from Henry.

而你把它转化为普遍需求的方式就是说，“我需要你的支持。”并不是每个人都需要亨利的支持。

But everyone does  need support and I says you include from you, it stops being universal.

但是每个人都需要支持，我说你包括你自己，它不再是普遍的。

So you  want to be really careful of this.

所以你要非常小心。

Okay.

好吧。

Requests versus demand.

请求与需求。

So at the very  end, so basically said like, "Hey, I noticed something that can't be refuted.

所以在最后，基本上说，“嘿，我注意到一些无法反驳的东西。

I told  you about a feeling and how it impacts me.

我告诉过你一种感觉以及它对我的影响。

And I told you that basically  it results in some universal need that we all can agree that we need to  have.

我告诉过你，基本上它导致了一些普遍的需求，我们都可以同意，我们需要拥有。

And now we get to saying what we'd like to have changed as a  result." And where you want to make is a request, not a demand.

现在我们可以说出我们希望改变的结果。“而你想要提出的是一个请求，而不是一个要求。

The difference  is that a request is an invitation to the other person to meet our universal  needs.

不同之处在于，请求是对另一个人的邀请，以满足我们的普遍需求。

It's much easier to be able to do than to say like, "I order  you to do something.

能够做到比说“我命令你做某事”要容易得多。

So what we want to do is make it very specific,  our requests.

所以我们想做的是让它非常具体，我们的要求。

So I request for you to be more respectful is not that great  because who defines what's respectful? My version of respectful might be different from someone else's.

所以我要求你更尊重并不是很好，因为谁定义了什么是尊重？我对尊重的理解可能与其他人的不同。

 Your request should be something like, "I request that you arrive to meetings on time."  Say what you want.

你的要求应该是这样的，“我要求你准时到达会议。”想说什么就说吧。

Don't say what you don't want.

不要说你不想要的东西。

So what a lot of  people will say is, "I request that you don't dismiss other people's ideas straight away."  The thing is it doesn't indicate the behavior that you do want.

所以很多人会说，“我请求你不要马上否定别人的想法。”问题是它并没有表明你确实想要的行为。

And so it  becomes really difficult to act on a better one would be, I request that when  a team member shares an idea, you ask two or three probing questions before sharing  a conclusion.

所以很难对一个更好的想法采取行动，我要求当一个团队成员分享一个想法时，你在分享结论之前问两三个探索性的问题。

And then stay curious.

然后保持好奇。

And so sometimes you might make a request and  someone might say, "No." And what you need to do is not just freak out  that the whole process isn't working.

因此，有时你可能会提出一个请求，有人可能会说，“不。”你需要做的不只是害怕整个过程都不起作用。

The idea is actually they'd be like maybe I  haven't put this request in a way that can meet more needs than just myself.

实际上，他们会说，也许我没有把这个要求放在一个可以满足更多需求的方式，而不仅仅是我自己。

 Could I do this in a way so that they can understand and be on  board for everyone to be sort of involved.

我能不能以一种方式这样做，这样他们就可以理解并在船上让每个人都参与进来。

If you want to learn more there's  a really great article on Delivering Constructive Feedback and Different situations by Dave Bailey [zombied],  I'll have a link to it and he goes into far more detail and is  a very, very good starting point for giving out this really hard feedback.

如果你想了解更多，Dave Bailey[Zombied]写了一篇关于提供建设性反馈和不同情况的非常棒的文章，我会有一个链接，他会进入更多的细节，是一个非常好的起点，可以给出这种非常艰难的反馈。

We all  know what technical debt is? So when we're building out software really, really quickly, and  sometimes you're like, "Well, that's not going to scale really well and it's going to  be dirty and quick, but I'm going to get it out the door and I'm  just going to put that in the back of my mind as something I have  to fix later." Well, in our relationships another, you will incur emotional debt.

我们都知道什么是技术债务吗？因此，当我们非常快地构建软件时，有时你会说，“嗯，这不会很好地扩展，它会很脏很快，但我会把它拿出来，我只是想把它放在我的脑海里，作为我以后必须修复的东西。”嗯，在我们的关系中，你会招致情感上的债务。

And unlike  technical debt, you really don't want that to go for very long.

与技术债务不同的是，你真的不希望这种情况持续很长时间。

You want to  pay this down every day.

你想每天都付清这笔钱。

So it turns out also in John Gottman's research that  it wasn't that people who were really good at being in a marriage only thought  about really big things.

因此，在约翰·戈特曼的研究中也证明了，真正擅长婚姻生活的人并不是只想着真正的大事。

It turns out they like would immediately bring up stuff even  when it's really tiny or small.

事实证明，他们喜欢立即提出的东西，即使它真的很小或很小。

They would never let a small thing grow to  be a medium thing.

他们永远不会让一个小东西成长为一个中等的东西。

And then eventually a big thing they immediately will talk about  is like, "Oh man can you close your mouth when you're chewing real quick.

最后，他们马上会谈论的一件大事就是，“哦，伙计，当你快速咀嚼的时候，你能闭上你的嘴吗？”

It's  just like kind of bothering me right now." And then do it in a way  that sort of respectful.

这就像是在困扰我现在。“然后以一种尊重的方式去做。

And so like when you're with your co-founders and you're in  this really sensitive relationship and you're finding stuff that's being really troubling, like you can  communicate those needs really quickly and you will prevent those small things from becoming big  things.

就像当你和你的联合创始人在一段非常敏感的关系中，你发现一些非常麻烦的事情，比如你可以非常迅速地表达这些需求，你会阻止那些小事情变成大事情。

The best way to start doing this is the practice.

开始这样做的最好方法就是练习。

So at YC we  call these level three conversations.

所以在YC，我们称之为三级对话。

So level one is that informal conversation and we have  other people where it's just like data exchange, passing information back and forth.

所以第一级是非正式的对话，我们有其他人，就像数据交换一样，来回传递信息。

Level two  conversations, have some emotions, talk about some things that are personal level three conversations.

第二级对话，有一些情绪，谈论一些个人第三级对话。

They're  relational, they're engaged with something that's happening right now between two people.

他们是有关系的，他们参与了现在两个人之间正在发生的事情。

That is super,  super important.

这是超级的，超级重要的。

It is a deep dive into what it might be really troubling and  what might be really mattering to two people.

这是一次深入探讨什么可能真正令人烦恼，什么可能对两个人真正重要。

And then in a startup, there's a  lot of things that's going to matter to all of the people working on the  company.

然后在一家初创公司，有很多事情对所有在公司工作的人都很重要。

So let's go through some examples of things that you guys can do after  this talk.

所以，让我们通过一些例子，你们可以在这个演讲后做的事情。

So goals, some good ones are, what are our short term goals for  the company? You'd be surprised at how often people are not on the same page  about this.

所以目标，一些好的目标是，我们公司的短期目标是什么？你会惊讶于人们在这件事上经常意见不一。

Are we using the right metrics? We've got lectures on those.

我们是否使用了正确的度量标准？我们有关于这些的讲座。

The answers,  I hope so by now.

答案，我希望现在是这样。

And then are we...

然后我们.。

That's supposed to be hitting our  goals, not hiring our goals? Are we hitting our goals? Roles? Who's responsible for what?  Super sensitive, right? So is it clear who is responsible for what? Like just have  that conversation.

这应该达到我们的目标，而不是雇佣我们的目标？我们达到目标了吗？角色？谁要对什么负责？超级敏感对吧？那么谁应该对什么负责清楚了吗？就像刚才的谈话一样。

Do we agree that the current division makes the most sense? And this  might be super simple answers, but if there is any kind of disagreement, we want  to hash that out.

我们是否同意目前的划分是最有意义的？这可能是超级简单的答案，但如果有任何分歧，我们想要解决这个问题。

And performance oh, okay, so is our workload distributed in an  optimal manner today? Do we all feel a high level of dedication and a motivation  right now? Great thing to just check on every day.

还有性能哦，好的，那么我们的工作负载今天是以最佳的方式分配的吗？我们现在是不是都感觉到了高度的奉献精神和动力？每天检查一下是件很棒的事情。

And then what mechanisms are  in place for providing feedback to one another? Have we carved out time for paying  down emotional debt? Do we feel like we can have these level three conversations at  any time? Do we have a process in place for taking through this stuff so  that we can be honest about where we are in our company? There's some things  up how to work together.

那么，有什么机制可以相互提供反馈呢？我们有没有腾出时间来偿还情感上的债务？我们是否觉得我们可以随时进行这些三级对话？我们有没有一个处理这些东西的程序，这样我们就可以诚实地说出我们在公司的位置？有一些事情是关于如何一起工作的。

Everyone fights, so you want to make a plan, you  need to figure out what's your attachment style, what's your roles, what's your goals and  a process before emotions get involved.

每个人都在战斗，所以你想要制定一个计划，你需要弄清楚你的依恋风格，你的角色，你的目标和过程，在情绪介入之前。

Do it while you're sober.

趁你清醒的时候做吧。

Use nonviolent communication, the  share honest feedback without criticism, and then pay down emotional debt on a regular basis.

使用非暴力沟通，分享诚实的反馈而不是批评，然后定期还清情感债务。

 This is the most healthy way that you will make sure that things will not  turn into a giant blow up.

这是最健康的方式，你将确保事情不会变成一个巨大的爆炸。

You can start having hard conversations right now.

你现在可以开始艰难的谈话了。

There's  no doubt in my mind that there's probably some issue that the two of you  or three of you or four of you or God forbid seven of you are  not talking about.

毫无疑问，在我的脑海中，可能有一些问题，你们两个，三个，你们四个，或者上帝不允许你们中的七个人不谈论。

Thank you very much.

非常感谢。

All right, we're going to open it up  to questions.

好的，我们要开始提问了。

Who wants to share their emotional problems? Yes.

谁想分享他们的情感问题？是。

Right here.

就在这儿。

Menu Hashtag.

菜单标签。

Yeah.
Speaker 2:So one of our co-founders just walked out on us last week.
Speaker 1:It sucks.
Speaker 2:So yeah.

嗯。演讲者2：所以我们的一个联合创始人上周刚刚离开了我们。扬声器1：太糟糕了。扬声器2：所以是的。

It kind of affected our [inaudible] a lot, but we're just wondering if  that's too early to wrap up and put things on paper and let them sign  so that there's no [inaudible] in the future anything like that [inaudible].
Speaker 1:Trying to think.

它对我们的[听不见]影响很大，但我们只是想知道，现在把东西包起来，写在纸上，让他们签字，这样将来就不会有[听不见]这样的事情了。演讲者1：试着思考。

So the question is, you just had a co-founder that's left and  then is it too late to do all the legal stuff you need to iron  things out?
Speaker 2:Yeah, is it too early because we are not a registered as company yet.
Speaker 1:Well, if you haven't registered as a company, then there's no shares to fight over  technically, and it's over only overwork.

所以问题是，你刚刚有一个联合创始人离开了，然后做所有你需要的法律事务来解决问题是不是太晚了？演讲者2：是的，是不是太早了，因为我们还没有注册为公司。演讲者1：嗯，如果你还没有注册为一家公司，那么从技术上讲，就没有股份可争了，只是因为过度劳累。

The only legal thing that might be tricky is  that it was there an understanding that people are supposed to be paid for their  work or not? But I take it, there's probably also no contracts at all.

唯一可能棘手的法律问题是，是否有一种理解，人们应该为他们的工作获得报酬？但我认为，也可能根本没有合同。

And  so that's the other thing that people sometimes run into issues with their co-founders.

这就是人们有时会和他们的联合创始人遇到问题的另一件事。

It's  just like, oh, we've been working on this but we haven't been paying ourselves.

这就像，哦，我们一直在努力，但我们没有支付自己。

And  then when someone gets angry and left, they hadn't been paying themselves a minimum wage.

然后，当有人生气并离开时，他们没有给自己支付最低工资。

 And then he has a viable case for saying like, "Hey, I haven't been paid  for the work I've done." I take it, there's been no contract signed.

然后他有一个可行的理由说，“嘿，我所做的工作没有得到报酬。”我想，还没有签订合同。

It is  not too early to go remedy all that so that you protect yourself.

现在去补救所有这些都不是太早，这样你就能保护你自己。

You definitely  want to put things in place like vesting and clear understandings of the relationships amongst  the founders and understanding like who owns the equity, who is the CEO, who ultimately  makes the decision so that way it will prevent future stuff from causing problems.

你肯定想要做好一些事情，比如归属和明确了解创始人之间的关系，以及理解谁拥有股权，谁是首席执行官，谁最终做出决定，这样就可以防止未来的事情造成问题。

Right  here.
Speaker 3:So as you start building up a team, how do you reconcile firing fast with  forming a good relationships?
Speaker 1:So as you build up the team, how do you reconcile firing fast versus building  good relationships? So hopefully you will do everything you can just try to establish good  relationships.

就在这里。演讲者3：那么当你开始建立一个团队时，你如何协调快速射击和建立良好的关系？演讲者1：那么当你组建团队时，你如何协调快速解雇和建立良好关系？所以希望你会尽你所能建立良好的关系。

There are some cases where if you've done all of these things and the  person does not want to engage, they don't want communicate in a nonviolent way.

在有些情况下，如果你已经做了所有这些事情，而这个人不想参与，他们就不想以非暴力的方式进行交流。

They  refuse to do the things that will prevent them.

他们拒绝做那些会阻止他们的事情。

And you basically notice that there's  all these conflicts with those four horsemen.

你基本上注意到，所有这些冲突都是和那四个骑手的。

To me, those are indications that like, "Hey,  this person we've already talked about, we had a plan for how to deal with  this stuff and you're not sticking to the plan.

对我来说，这些迹象就像，“嘿，我们已经谈过的这个人，我们有一个如何处理这些东西的计划，而你没有坚持计划。

And as far as I'm concerned,  you're not meeting your end of the bargain." And so to me, again, there's a  balance.

据我所知，你没有达到你的目标。“所以对我来说，再次，有一个平衡。

There is like you do all this stuff, yes, but if it's not working  out, you need to move on because otherwise you affect other people in the team  and the other morale.

就像你做了所有这些事情，是的，但是如果不成功，你需要继续前进，因为否则你会影响团队中的其他人和其他士气。

I've never talked to a founder who eventually fired someone that  they were having a problem with and then regretted it.

我从来没有和一个创始人谈过，他最终解雇了一个与他们有问题的人，然后又后悔了。

Usually you're always like, "Why  didn't I do that sooner?" The best advice I ever heard about this is from  Max Levchin, who's the founder of PayPal.

通常你总是这样，“为什么我不早点这么做？”关于这一点，我听到的最好的建议来自贝宝(PayPal)的创始人马克斯·莱夫钦(Max Levchin)。

And he basically says like, "If there's doubt,  then there is no doubt." So once you start feeling like there's something wrong, the  problem...

他基本上说，“如果有疑问，那就没有疑问。”所以一旦你开始觉得有什么不对劲，问题就来了.

It's basically not going to go away.

它基本上不会消失。

And now you're losing mental energy and  shares over the problem with that relationship over solving things to help the company grow.

现在你正在失去精神能量和分享解决问题的关系，而不是解决问题来帮助公司发展。

 And quite honestly, it's so hard to do a startup finding a battle on multiple  fronts mentally and emotionally is just like really, really difficult.

老实说，创业公司很难在精神上和情感上找到多条战线上的战斗真的很难。

And that's what used to  eat a lot of startups.

这就是过去吞噬很多初创企业的原因。

In the back there.
Speaker 4:There are some pretty successful founders who somewhat famously mystically are not people people.

在后面。演讲者4：有一些相当成功的创始人，有些神秘地出名的不是人。

So  if that was one of your co-founders, how do I do this but avoid firing  Steve jobs as a co-founder?
Speaker 1:So there are some people who are assholes, famous assholes as founders, how to deal  with that.

那么，如果那是你的联合创始人之一，我该怎么做才能避免解雇史蒂夫·乔布斯作为联合创始人呢？演讲者1：所以有一些人是混蛋，著名的混蛋作为创始人，如何处理这个问题。

If that turns out to be one of my co-founders? And you have  to decide together what kind of company that you want to run.

如果那是我的联合创始人之一？你必须一起决定你想经营什么样的公司。

And so you  together have decided that it's okay for him to have that behavior, then that's really  on you to sort of decide and have that sort of compact.

所以你们一起决定，他有这样的行为是可以的，那么这真的是由你来决定，并有那种契约的。

I'll tell you  our feelings at YC.

我会告诉你我们在YC的感受

And so in the early days of YC, PG kind of  selfishly optimize the program for like, I'm only going to fund people that I want  to have dinner with every week because I got to spend a lot of time  with these people.

所以在YC的早期，PG有点自私地优化程序，比如，我只会资助那些每周都想和我一起吃饭的人，因为我要花很多时间和这些人在一起。

So he was like, "No assholes." And not because he thought that  assholes can't found huge [inaudible] companies like back in 2005, like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates,  like those were the role models for a founder CEOs.

所以他说“没有混蛋”这并不是因为他认为混蛋们找不到像2005年那样的大型[听不见的]公司，比如史蒂夫·乔布斯(Steve Jobs)，比尔·盖茨(Bill Gates)，他们都是创始人CEO的榜样。

But for him he was  optimizing for his time and energy and presence.

但对他来说，他在优化自己的时间、精力和存在。

And the surprising side effect was that  a room full of people who were lovely to have dinner with, they help one  another and they still found billion dollar companies and those people are really great community  members inside of YC.

令人惊讶的副作用是，一屋子的人很喜欢和他们共进晚餐，他们互相帮助，他们仍然发现了价值数十亿美元的公司，那些人在YC内部是非常棒的社区成员。

It's one of the reasons why the YC network works out  really well.

这是YC网络运行得非常好的原因之一。

They are good at hiring people, bringing people along, getting people excited, they're  easy to get funding because investors want to work with them, et cetera.

他们擅长雇佣人，带人来，让人兴奋，他们很容易获得资金，因为投资者想要与他们合作，等等。

And so  for us, we optimize the, not have that experience with our founders and we might  leave some money on the table as a result.

所以对我们来说，我们优化了，而不是和我们的创始人一起经历，我们可能会留下一些钱在桌面上。

But because I will work with  over a hundred new companies a year and I've worked with over a thousand, almost  2000 companies, then the result is I build up this huge alumni base and I  can't have a bunch of assholes in there that takes away attention from one another.

但是因为我一年会和超过100家新公司合作，我已经和超过1000家，将近2000家公司合作过，结果就是我建立了这个庞大的校友基础，我不能让一群混蛋在那里夺走彼此的注意力。

 So again, there's plenty of counterexamples to people being good, but I would like to  believe and what I would hope for everyone and started schools that you could have  a company that's different, that you can believe that this is a much easier way  to run a company than one run by dictatorship and fear.

所以，再一次，有很多反例表明人们是好的，但我愿意相信，我希望每个人都能有这样的学校，你可以拥有一家与众不同的公司，你可以相信，这是一种比独裁和恐惧经营的公司容易得多的管理方式。

Right here.
Speaker 5:Other than no asshole policy or any other guard rails or suggestions for best practices  for delineating these roles?
Speaker 1:Other than no assholes.

就在这儿。演讲者5：除了没有混蛋政策或任何其他护栏或最佳实践的建议外，如何界定这些角色？扬声器1：除了没有混蛋。

Are there any other guard rails or best practices for delineating  these roles? I don't really talk about it here, but like are they people you  want to spend a lot of time with? Kind of like what PG talked about.

是否有任何其他护栏或最佳实践来描述这些角色？我并不是真的在这里谈论它，但就像他们是你想花很多时间在一起的人吗？有点像PG所说的。

 And so a lot of things might indicate that in different ways.

因此，很多事情可能会以不同的方式表明这一点。

It could be.

可能会吧。

 It's like, you know what, this person isn't going to bother me.

就像，你知道吗，这个人不会打扰我。

Is it going  to be really needy? And so I could spend a lot of time with them.

真的会很需要吗？所以我可以花很多时间和他们在一起。

 And there's other people, there's like, this guy is not very fun.

还有其他人，就像，这个家伙不是很有趣。

He's not going  play video games with me on our time off.

他不会在我们休息的时候和我一起玩电子游戏。

I can't do with this.

我受不了这个

And  so really you're optimizing not just for like can I work on an idea for  10 years, but can I just spend a lot of time with this person for  10 years? You might think that that's connected that asshole, but it might be completely  different.

所以你真的在优化，不只是为了，我能不能花10年的时间研究一个想法，但我能不能花很多时间和这个人在一起10年？你可能认为这和那个混蛋有关，但它可能是完全不同的。

Like your needs for your kind of relationship is very, very different as a  result.

就像你对你的关系的需求是非常，非常不同的结果。

I can't think of anything else off the top of my head.

我脑子里想不出别的事了。

Oh, they  have to be someone you trust.

哦，他们必须是你信任的人。

If you're going to assign them a portion of  the company, you're going to give them half of the equity.

如果你要给他们分配公司的一部分，你就会给他们一半的股权。

Then you have to  believe in them 100% that they are going to do what's right for the company  no matter what.

然后，你必须百分之百地相信他们，无论发生什么，他们都会为公司做正确的事情。

That's going to make it easy for you to give up the  equity or split the equity between the both of you.

这将使你很容易放弃股权或在你们两人之间分配股权。

But if you don't trust  your co-founder, then it will lead to things like you will micromanage them.

但如果你不信任你的联合创始人，那么就会导致你会对他们进行微观管理之类的事情。

You will  worry about what they do with their time.

你会担心他们用他们的时间做什么。

You will spend a lot of time  thinking about them instead of thinking about the business.

你会花很多时间思考它们，而不是考虑业务。

So figure out how to find  someone that you really, really trust or figure out if are you the kind of  person that can let go and trust someone and truly share the load.

所以，弄清楚如何找到你真正信任的人，或者弄清楚你是否是那种可以放手、信任某人并真正分担责任的人。

Because having  a co-founder or bring on employees, it's really about being humble enough to say like,  "I can't do this by myself.

因为有一个联合创始人或引入员工，这真的是要足够谦虚地说，“我一个人做不了这件事。

I need you." And that kind of vulnerability is  something that most people don't realize.

我需要你。“而这种脆弱是大多数人没有意识到的。

Lot of people think that the way they attract  other co-founders is by saying is like, "I'm super fucking awesome and you're lucky to  be on my bandwagon.

很多人认为他们吸引其他联合创始人的方式就是这样说，“我他妈的超级棒，你很幸运能加入我的潮流。

That's not the kind of person I want to be on.

那不是我想要的那种人。

 But someone who says like, "Man, I'm trying to make things happen and I think  we could make the magic happen twice as fast as you were on my team.

但是有人说，“伙计，我正在努力让事情发生，我认为我们可以让奇迹发生的速度是你在我的团队里的两倍。”

 I'd be so lucky to have you on here.

有你在我会很幸运的。

Do you want to join me?"  Such a different attitude.

你想加入我吗？“态度如此不同。

Right here.
Speaker 6:Me?
Speaker 1:Yeah.
Speaker 6:How do you suggest trialing these relationships? Like doing the dating before you get married?  Do you take them in as contractors first or what have you seen work well,  if you start solo?
Speaker 1:So how do you trial out a relationship, because like you don't like start a  date by proposing to someone and so you don't immediately like get excited about it.

就在这儿。扬声器6：我？扬声器1：是的。演讲者6：你建议如何尝试这些关系？比如在结婚前约会？你是先接受他们作为承包商吗？或者如果你开始单干，你看到什么工作做得很好？演讲者1：那么你如何尝试一段关系，因为就像你不喜欢通过向某人求婚来开始约会，所以你不会立即对此感到兴奋。

 Like, Oh, do you like Blockchain? I like Blockchain.

就像，哦，你喜欢区块链吗？我喜欢区块链。

Do you want to sign this  clerky document together and join a four year vesting agreement with me? So one way  as you talked about is that you might contract someone.

你想和我一起签署这份正式文件并加入一项为期四年的归属协议吗？所以，正如你所说的一种方式是，你可能会与某人签约。

So if you end up  having money and you want to try out working with someone, you can do that.

因此，如果你最终有钱，你想尝试与某人合作，你可以做到这一点。

 So a good famous example is actually 37 signals.

所以一个很好的著名的例子实际上是37个信号。

So Jason Fried hired David Heinemeier  Hansson off of a forum and basically through that relationship ended up finding a co-founder.

因此，杰森·弗里德从一个论坛雇佣了大卫·海内梅尔·汉森，基本上通过这种关系，最终找到了一个联合创始人。

 I would recommend you start off with something small.

我建议你从小的开始。

You don't immediately start with marriage,  you start with like movie and or whatever.

你不会立即从婚姻开始，你会从电影之类的东西开始。

And so just do a project together.

所以一起做一个项目。

 And so it might not be the ultimate thing that the company is, but maybe  it's like, Oh, if you're already working on your company, maybe there's some project that  you want to have involved.

所以这可能不是公司的终极目标，但也许它就像，哦，如果你已经在你的公司工作了，也许有一些你想参与的项目。

I would go, you have lots of other steps before  that.

我会去的，在那之前你还有很多其他的步骤。

So number one is like, have a good conversation.

所以第一个就是，有一个愉快的谈话。

Can we consistently have good  conversations? Can we have disagreements about ideas? Can we discover something new or more interesting  as a result of us interacting? Do we make each other better without placating to  one another? So like having a bunch of conversations, it was a good one.

我们能一直保持良好的对话吗？我们在想法上会有分歧吗？通过我们的互动，我们能发现一些新的或更有趣的东西吗？我们是不是在没有安抚对方的情况下让彼此变得更好？所以就像有一堆对话一样，这是一个很好的对话。

And  then exchanging of favors.

然后互惠互利。

So maybe the other person has some other ideas and you  have some ideas.

所以也许另一个人有一些其他的想法，而你有一些想法。

And so right now you're neither one of are quite ready to  give up on whatever it is that you're working on.

所以现在你既不是一个人，也没有准备好放弃你正在做的任何事情。

I would exchange favors and  take turns working on each other's stuff and get a sense for like, oh, does  this person keep their promises? Do they work really hard? Did they do things that  I'm not good at? Do they compliment me? Et cetera.

我会交换帮助，轮流处理彼此的东西，并得到这样的感觉，哦，这个人信守他们的承诺吗？他们真的很努力吗？他们是不是做了我不擅长的事？他们称赞我吗？等等。

There's so many little things  in your interactions that you're basically trying to basically build a working small relationship.

在你的互动中有如此多的小事情，以至于你基本上试图建立一个有效的小关系。

I  think you could start, the conversation would be like, "Hey, I think you might be  a good co-founder can we start doing all this other stuff?" I feel like does  a little forward but is very honest thing.

我认为你可以开始，对话会像，“嘿，我想你可能是一个很好的联合创始人，我们可以开始做其他所有的事情吗？”我觉得自己做的有点前瞻，但却是非常诚实的事情。

The habit.

习惯。

It's like, look, I'll just  be honest with you.

就像，听着，我就跟你说实话。

"I'm looking for a co-founder.

“我在找一位联合创始人。

You might fit the bill.

你可能符合要求。

Let's  start doing a couple of little things together and spending more time increasing it.

让我们开始一起做一些小事情，花更多的时间来增加它。

Let's  just put time on the calendar and see what happens." I think this happened with  Tracy.

让我们把时间放在日历上，看看会发生什么。“我认为这发生在特雷西身上。

She's got a podcast, she's the founder of Plan Grid and she talks about  how she had the standing a Google calendar invite with her potential co-founder and they  would just spend a couple of hours every week just brainstorming.

她有一个播客，她是Plan Grid的创始人，她谈到她是如何与潜在的联合创始人一起接受谷歌日历邀请的，他们每周只会花几个小时进行头脑风暴。

They just thought like,  "Hey, we have a lot of potential between us, let's just like talk about ideas  on a regular basis and see if we come up with anything." Oddly enough, what  actually started the company off is that the person she was dating at the time,  she had like given Google calendar access.

他们只是想，“嘿，我们之间有很大的潜力，让我们就像定期讨论想法，看看我们能不能想出点什么。”奇怪的是，真正开始这家公司的是她当时的约会对象，她喜欢访问谷歌日历。

Like that was at that modern step in  the relationship.

就像这是在关系中的现代的一步。

And he was like, what's this recurring appointment with this guy that's happening  for several hours every week? What's going on with that? And she's like, oh, we're  trying to think through some ideas for this.

他说，这个人每周有几个小时的反复约会是怎么回事？这是怎么回事？她说，哦，我们正在想办法解决这个问题。

And it turns out it's like building  basically a way of doing construction documents on the iPad.

事实证明，这就像是在iPad上构建建筑文档的一种方式。

And he was just like,  "What's wrong with you Tracy? Don't you know, I'm an IOS engineer.

他就像是，“你怎么了，特蕾西？难道你不知道，我是一名iOS工程师。

Like, why have  you talked to me about this?" And that's other company got started.

比如，你为什么要跟我谈这个？“这就是另一家公司成立了。

Right here.
Speaker 7:[inaudible] relationships while working remotely.
Speaker 1:Say that again sir?
Speaker 7:While working remotely how would you strengthen those co-founder relationship?
Speaker 1:So if you are working remotely with a team, how do you strengthen these relationships?  So actually it's really interesting.

就在这儿。扬声器7：[听不见]远程工作时的关系。演讲者1：再说一遍，先生？演讲者7：在远程工作的同时，你会如何加强这些联合创始人的关系？演讲者1：那么，如果你正在与一个团队远程工作，你如何加强这些关系？所以实际上这真的很有趣。

I talk a little bit about this with Mike.

我和迈克谈了一下这件事。

He's  the head of one of the founders of Zapier on a YC podcast.

他是YC播客上Zapier创始人之一的负责人。

But basically  when you're going remote, there's a lot of things that you have to now do  up front in terms of your communication and relationship building that you took for granted  when you just work in a building with someone else.

但基本上当你要去远程时，在你的沟通和关系建设方面，有很多事情你必须事先做，当你只是和别人一起工作时，你认为这是理所当然的。

So number one is like,  trust has to be really high.

所以第一个就是，信任必须非常高。

You have to be really, really clear about like  what we're doing, what is shipping, what's being done, and making sure everyone understands that  everyone is on the same page.

你必须非常清楚我们在做什么，运输什么，正在做什么，并确保每个人都明白每个人都在同一页上。

You have to overshare.

你必须过度分享。

And that's something that a  lot of companies when they're just working together in the same space, get to not  have to practice very well.

这是很多公司在同一个领域合作时，不需要很好地实践的一件事。

It just kind of naturally sort of happens in discussions.

它只是在讨论中自然而然地发生。

 So remote working.

如此远程工作。

You basically have to plan it.

基本上你得计划一下。

You have to deliberately do this  sort of action.

你必须有意识地做这种动作。

Secondly, you have to be very, very good at written communication.

其次，你必须非常善于书面交流。

And  so you actually get really good at saying like, "Hey, I have a problem, I  have an issue, et cetera." But also you have to be really good at giving  people the benefit of the doubt.

所以你真的很擅长说，“嘿，我有一个问题，等等。”但你也必须非常善于给予人们怀疑的好处。

Like the people you'll bring on for remote workers,  you have to trust them because they're working from home.

就像你将为远程工作人员带来的人一样，你必须信任他们，因为他们在家里工作。

You can't see them.

你看不到他们。

And  so by default, your relationship with the other remote worker is that I trust you  that I can't see you, but you're going to still do what's best for the  company.

因此，默认情况下，您与其他远程员工的关系是我信任您，我看不到您，但您仍然会做对公司最有利的事情。

And that's such a powerful feeling to have that you don't realize that you  take it for granted when you just work with someone inside of a building that  immediately changes when you see the person leave and you're like, oh, are they even  here? Are they even doing anything? Et cetera.

这是一种如此强烈的感觉，以至于你没有意识到，当你只是与建筑物内的某个人一起工作时，当你看到某人离开，你就会想，哦，他们在这里吗？当你看到这个人离开时，你会立即改变，你没有意识到你认为这是理所当然的吗？他们到底在做什么吗？等等。

So to me, for remote working, all  the stuff that you have to do to state all this stuff ahead of time,  you actually are the only way that you'll be successful at remote working.

所以对我来说，对于远程工作，你必须提前陈述所有这些东西，你实际上是你在远程工作中取得成功的唯一途径。

And so  I actually think is it's more that if you're working in an office altogether, what  are the things you have to be cognizant that you are being lazy about, right?  That our remote working team is going to be ahead of you on it.

所以我实际上认为更多的是，如果你在一个办公室工作，你必须意识到你在懒惰的事情是什么，对吗？我们的远程工作组将在这方面领先于您。

And  so a lot of that is communication, transparency and trust.

所以其中很大一部分是沟通，透明度和信任。

Right here.
Speaker 8:Yes, this is great advice.

就在这儿。演讲者8：是的，这是一个很好的建议。

I'm thinking in terms of as prevention, what about if  you actually going through a conflict and you try to deescalate? Do you have any  tips and asking for a friend?
Speaker 1:So what if you're currently going through a conflict right now, how do you deescalate  the problem? So the first thing is someone has to like recognize as like we  are fighting in an unproductive way.

我想从预防的角度来看，如果你真的经历了一场冲突，并试图缓和局势，那怎么办？你有什么建议和要求朋友吗？演讲者1：那么，如果你现在正在经历一场冲突，你如何缓解这个问题呢？所以，第一件事就是有人必须承认我们在以一种无益的方式战斗。

We have to declare it and we have to  have everyone sort of agree that we're on the same page that like this isn't  working.

我们必须声明这一点，我们必须让每个人都同意，我们在同一页上，就像这样是行不通的。

I'll give you a tip that we used in our company.

我给你一个我们公司用过的小费。

And so, and  then had more to do with productivity, but it ended up resolving a lot of  sort of conflicts.

因此，然后与生产力有更多的关系，但它最终解决了很多种类的冲突。

And so at [Wufu] we basically were like, look, we hated meetings  were remote company and we were dedicating one day out of everyone's work week, do  you customer support.

所以在[五福]我们基本上就像，看，我们讨厌会议是远程公司，我们在每个人的一周工作中花一天时间，你客户支持吗。

And then we pushed all the meetings for the company to a  half day on Friday.

然后我们把公司的所有会议推迟到周五的半天。

So therefore Friday was a half day and one day was  support.

因此，星期五是半天，一天是支持。

And so you really had engineers having three solid days to do work.

所以你真的有工程师有三天的时间来工作。

But  we fully believe that three solid days and uninterrupted work is far more productive than  someone pretending to work for 40 hours for the week.

但我们完全相信，三天稳定的工作和不间断的工作比那些假装一周工作40个小时的人要有更高的效率。

Like we don't interrupt, et  cetera.

就像我们不打断，等等。

And so for that to be effective, we instituted a policy.

所以为了有效，我们制定了一项政策。

It's a 15  minute discussion policy.

这是15分钟的讨论政策。

So basically it said it's like any person could immediately table a  discussion if it's gone for 15 minutes.

所以基本上它说，就像任何人都可以立即提出一个讨论，如果它已经过去了15分钟。

So after it hits 15 minutes you're allowed  to say like, "Hey, you know what? Let's just put this away and we'll discuss  it at the Friday meeting and we'll move on to the other items on the  to do list.

所以在15分钟后，你可以说，“嘿，你知道吗？让我们把这个放一边，我们在周五的会议上讨论它，然后我们将继续处理待办事项清单上的其他事项。”

So if you had got into some kind of things that suck,  you should have enough things on your plate that you can just move on and  that you are not going to be stuck by one person.

所以，如果你已经陷入了某种糟糕的事情，你应该有足够的东西在你的盘子里，你可以继续前进，并且你不会被一个人卡住。

The result of this  policy was that people would usually sleep on it and the next day they would  just magically be like, "Oh, you know what? I figured something else out.

这项政策的结果是，人们通常会在它上面睡觉，第二天他们就会神奇地说，“哦，你知道吗？我想出了别的办法。

Or like  that's not a big issue anymore.

或者说这已经不是什么大问题了。

Or I don't care that much now that I  got some sleep." And then when we get to Friday to try to go like,  all right, what are all the on resolved issues? There would almost be nothing that  we'd have to talk about.

或者我现在已经不那么在意了，因为我睡了一会儿。“然后当我们到了周五试着去想，好吧，所有解决的问题是什么？我们几乎没有什么要谈的了。

Because usually allowing people to have a period of time  to cool off and think differently about the problem and realize like, oh there's got  to be a better way to work together.

因为通常允许人们有一段时间冷静下来，用不同的方式思考问题，然后意识到，哦，一定有更好的合作方式。

Made a huge difference.

产生了巨大的不同。

But I'd say  for you, the first thing is someone has to admit that like this isn't working  well and we need to change this process? And part of this process might be  like, we go through these steps that I've talked about.

但我想对你说，第一件事就是有人必须承认这样做并不好，我们需要改变这个过程？这个过程的一部分可能是，我们经历了我提到的这些步骤。

And then semi worst case  scenario is like you do couples counseling.

然后半个最坏的情况就像你做夫妻咨询一样。

So this is a common thing in the  bay area.

所以这在海湾地区是很常见的事情。

It was super rare in the early days of YC and now it's  become way more common for co-founders to go together and have some kind of intermediary  who would help kind of discuss all those sort of negative things that are going  on in the relationship and help them sort of see one another and realize that  like, hey, you still have shared values and missions.

在YC的早期，这是非常罕见的，现在，联合创始人走到一起，有某种中间人帮助讨论所有在关系中发生的负面事情，并帮助他们看到彼此，意识到，嘿，你们仍然有共同的价值观和使命，这已经变得越来越普遍了。

You just have different ways that  you want to approach it and that there's got to be a way that both  of you can get what you need, whether it's taking turns or making an agreement  or making concession, et cetera.

你只是想用不同的方式来接近它，而且必须有一种方式可以让你们双方都能得到你需要的东西，无论是轮流，还是达成协议，还是做出让步，等等。

Last question right here.
Speaker 9:Do you think you can change the attachment style over time?
Speaker 1:Do I think people can change their attachment style over time? I would like to  think so.

这里的最后一个问题。演讲者9：你认为你可以随着时间的推移改变附件的风格吗？演讲者1：我认为随着时间的推移，人们可以改变他们的依恋方式吗？我希望是这样。

I'd like to think that people eventually become secure and not, I would  say my attachment style is definitely avoidant, dismissive.

我倾向于认为人们最终会变得安全，而不是，我会说我的依恋风格绝对是回避的，不屑一顾的。

That's usually my first thing is just  like someone tells you there's a problem, like, no, no, there's no problem.

这通常是我的第一件事，就像有人告诉你有一个问题，就像，不，没有问题。

It's going  to be okay.

一切都会好起来的。

It's fine.

很好。

We're champions.

我们是冠军。

That's not get into it just now.

现在还没开始呢。

And  then I walk away.

然后我就走开了。

Over time I've realized like that's what I do and I  work really hard to be like, "Okay, my instinct is to want to sleep on  this right now.

随着时间的推移，我意识到我就是这样做的，我非常努力地工作，“好吧，我的本能就是现在就想睡觉。

Can you honor that for me? And then we will definitely discuss  it tomorrow morning and work on it." And so I wouldn't say that that's as  like getting to the secure part, but at least I'm doing it in a way  that like I recognize my weaknesses and slowly get to the point where it's like,  "Oh, you know what? I don't need to sleep on it.

你能为我尊重这一点吗？然后我们明天早上肯定会讨论它并进行工作。“所以我不会说这就像是进入安全的部分，但至少我是这样做的，就像我认识到自己的弱点，然后慢慢地达到这样的程度，”哦，你知道吗？我不需要睡在上面。

I can figure out  things a rationally between the two of us right now." That's the goal.

我现在可以理性地解决我们两个人之间的问题。“这就是我们的目标。

Okay.

好吧。

Thank  you very much.

非常感谢。

I'll let you guys mingle.

我让你们混在一起。
