# Anu Hariharan - Nine Business Models and the Metrics Investors Want
Anu:Thank you all for having me, and it's so awesome to see so many of  you at 9:00 A.M.

ANU：谢谢大家邀请我，早上9：00看到你们这么多人真是太棒了。

In the morning to discuss metrics.

早上讨论指标。

Let's hope we keep you  engaged until the end of the session.

希望我们能让你一直参与到会议结束。

How do we think about what metrics to  track? Our advice is find out which business model you fit in.

我们如何看待要跟踪的指标？我们的建议是找出你适合哪种商业模式。

The most common  thing people do is which industry or [inaudible 00:00:24].

人们做的最常见的事情是哪个行业或[听不见的00：00：24]。

Are you health care? Are you  biotech or are you enterprise? But that's not really the best way to think of  metrics.

你是医疗保健人员吗？你是生物技术还是企业？但这并不是考虑指标的最好方式。

The best way to think of metrics is how do you plan to charge  your users, which is the business model? And which of these business models do you  fit in? So roughly there are nine business models.

考虑指标的最佳方式是您计划如何向您的用户收取费用，这就是业务模型？你适合这些商业模式中的哪一种？所以大致上有九种商业模式。

I would say 99% of you  should fit into one of these categories.

我想说你们中的99%应该属于这些类别中的一个。

If you don't, you're probably building something that's  incredibly hard, which is what we call moonshot.

如果你不这样做，你可能正在建造一些非常困难的东西，这就是我们所说的月球发射。

So I'll walk you through for the  rest of the presentation on each business model and what three or four metrics you  need to track.

因此，我将向您介绍关于每个业务模型的其余演示文稿，以及您需要跟踪的三四个指标。

Beyond three to four, honestly, at this stage is an overkill.

老实说，超过三到四个，在这个阶段是过度杀戮。

So  these are the things that would matter.

所以这些就是重要的事情。

So what is an enterprise business model? This  is a company that sells software or services to a large enterprise.

那么什么是企业商业模式呢？这是一家向大型企业销售软件或服务的公司。

Pretty simple.

很简单。

Very  few startups do that.

很少有初创公司这样做。

So I would imagine very few of you try to or  planning to launch something from day one that sells to say Facebook or Google or  Apple or any of them.

所以我想你们中很少有人会尝试或者计划从第一天开始就发布一些东西，比如Facebook，Google，Apple或者它们中的任何一个。

But if you are one of those companies, examples that  are like Docker, Cloudera, FireEye, even in the YC portfolio there are very few that  did that from day one.

但如果你是这些公司中的一家，像Docker，Cloudera，FireEye这样的例子，即使在YC组合中，也很少有从第一天起就这样做的。

But if you're one of them that sells to large  enterprises, you would categorize yourself in this category.

但如果你是其中之一，销售给大型企业，你会将自己归入这一类别。

And the large enterprises tend to work  in terms of contracts.

而大企业倾向于以合同的形式工作。

So your business model will come into three things, which are  the three metrics you track, which is bookings.

因此，您的业务模型将涉及三个方面，即您跟踪的三个指标，即预订。

So if you're working with say Facebook,  they'd say, "Hey, you are going to help us hire x engineers.

所以如果你和Facebook合作，他们会说，“嘿，你要帮我们雇佣x工程师。

We'd like to  sign $a hundred thousand dollar contract for next year." So that's why you'd say, "What  is my booking? What's the total number of unique customers I have? And what's revenue?"  The difference between booking and revenue is Facebook might sign a contract ahead of time,  would tell you at the start of the year that it's a hundred thousand for  x hires over the year.

我们想签下一年十万美元的合同。“所以这就是为什么你会说，”我的预订是什么？我的独特客户总数是多少？“预订和收入之间的区别是Facebook可能会提前签订合同，在年初会告诉你，一年内x的招聘人数是10万人。”(注：“预订”和“收入”之间的区别是Facebook可能会提前签署一份合同，并在今年年初告诉你，x员工的年收入是10万美元)。

That doesn't mean you recognize revenue straight away.

这并不意味着你可以马上认出收入。

You'd recognize  revenue only when you have delivered the service, either you've placed all the hires that  you've set in your contract or if it's an annual contract, you just divide it  monthly.

只有当你交付了服务时，你才会认识到收入，或者你已经把你在合同中设定的所有员工都放在了合同中，或者如果是年度合同，你只需按月分配就可以了。

So the common mistakes we see founders do is confusing bookings and revenue.

因此，我们看到创始人经常犯的错误是混淆预订和收入。

They  would have signed contracts but they haven't delivered anything.

他们本可以签署合同，但他们没有交付任何东西。

The contract hasn't even kicked in  but they're already reporting it as revenue.

合同甚至还没有生效，但他们已经把它作为收入报告了。

That's not true because you haven't delivered service.

这不是真的，因为你没有提供服务。

 So therefore it's not revenue.

因此，这不是收入。

And so you should hold yourself accountable for that like  the company is not generating revenue.

因此，你应该对此负责，就像公司没有产生收入一样。

The second common mistake, which is probably more relevant  at the stage that you're in is Facebook might have verbally told you, "I will  consider a hundred K contract, for them a hundred K's not a big deal for  a lot of you, it's a really big deal.

第二个常见的错误，在你所处的阶段可能更相关，Facebook可能会口头上告诉你，“我会考虑100K合同，对他们来说，100K对你们很多人来说都不是什么大事，这真的是一件大事。

That's neither booking, not revenue because  it's a well built offer.

这既不是预订，也不是收入，因为这是一个构建良好的报价。

So the other than, even if they signed a letter  of intent, it means nothing.

所以另外一个就是，即使他们签了意向书，也没有任何意义。

So you really have to have the contract written down,  signed for it to be bookings and for revenue only when you start delivering it.

所以你真的必须把合同写下来，只有在你开始交付的时候才能签署，才能成为预订和收入。

 The second business model is SaaS, which is probably where most of you fit in,  especially if you're in B2B or servicing to other companies.

第二种商业模式是SaaS，这可能是大多数人适合的地方，特别是如果你在B2B或为其他公司服务的话。

You're all probably thinking of  SaaS model.

你们可能都在考虑SaaS模式。

It's a very predominant model these days.

这是目前非常流行的型号。

You see a number of all  these other YC startups Segment, Ironclad, Sandberg, they all started with SaaS model, right from  day one.

你可以看到许多其他的YC初创公司Segment，ironclad，Sandberg，他们都是从SaaS模式开始的，从第一天开始。

SaaS is Software as a Service in terms of business model.

SaaS在业务模型方面是软件即服务。

It's really  subscription business.

这真的是订阅业务。

You charge something monthly for a software that you provide.

你为你提供的软件每月收取一些费用。

So what are  the four key metrics you would want to track? Well, if it's subscription, by definition,  the revenue is recurring, right? Which means if you hopefully have built something that people  really like, they'll continue to use it and they pay you every month.

那么，您希望跟踪的四个关键指标是什么？嗯，如果是订阅，按照定义，收入是经常性的，对吗？这意味着如果你希望你已经建立了一些人们真正喜欢的东西，他们会继续使用它，而且他们每个月都会给你钱。

So that's  why you track MRR at the highest level that is, Monthly Recurring Revenue.

所以这就是为什么你在最高水平跟踪MRR，也就是每月经常性收入。

How much  are you making monthly and what did the customers come at to it? ARR is  Annual Recurring Revenue.

你每月赚多少钱，顾客给你带来了什么？ARR是年度经常性收入。

Because of this phase, you're really growing fast.

因为这个阶段，你真的成长得很快。

You may be growing  30% week over week or 40% week over week.

你可能一周比一周增长30%，或者一周比一周增长40%。

So it's helpful to track your  annual recurring revenue as literally run rate.

所以它有助于跟踪您的年度经常性收入作为字面上的运行率。

So if this month you made 30,000 in  MRR and if it's truly recurring, you should expect that your annual recurring is 12  times that.

因此，如果这个月你在MRR中赚了3万，如果它真的是循环的，你应该期待你的年度循环是这个的12倍。

So it's just a good metric to use internally as well because it  helps show the pace rather than just looking at absolute.

因此，这只是一个很好的指标，也可以在内部使用，因为它有助于显示速度，而不是只看绝对。

The third thing you should  pay attention to is chart.

你应该注意的第三件事是图表。

So when you launch, there'll be few users who are  early adopters that use it, but you really should be paying attention to if they  stop using it, right? And if you're a subscription business, the chances are you probably  make 5,000 to $10,000 a month from two or three customers, or maybe even 10  so losing a customer means real impact on your revenue.

所以当你发布时，很少有用户是使用它的早期采用者，但是你真的应该注意他们是否停止使用它，对吗？如果你是订阅企业，你可能每月从两三个客户那里赚到5000到10000美元，甚至可能是10个，所以失去一个客户意味着你的收入会受到真正的影响。

And so this is why  we recommend measuring something called Gross MRR Churn, which is say at the start of  the month, you expected your monthly recurring revenue to be 10,000 but one customer churn  and they were paying 3,000 then that's your gross churn, 3,000 by 10,000.

这就是为什么我们建议测量所谓的总MRR流动率，也就是说，在月初，您预计每月的经常性收入为10，000，但只有一个客户流动率，他们支付了3，000，这就是您的总流动率，3，000乘以10，000。

So don't  blend it, because you're obviously acquiring new users and if you measure blended, your numbers  still look great, right? Because you're growing a lot, but you're not paying attention to  users that you're losing.

所以不要混合它，因为你显然正在获得新的用户，如果你测量混合，你的数字看起来仍然很棒，对吧？因为你成长了很多，但你没有关注你正在失去的用户。

And it's really important to learn from users you're losing, which  is why we ask you to measure the churn.

从你正在流失的用户那里学习是非常重要的，这就是为什么我们要求你测量流动率的原因。

Paid CAC.

付费CAC

This comes in a  little later, hopefully almost all of you are acquiring users organically.

这是稍后出现的，希望几乎所有人都能有机地获得用户。

I wouldn't recommend doing  any paid acquisition at this stage.

我不建议在这个阶段进行任何付费收购。

But if you do start doing some experiments where  you say, "Hey, I'm going to do a little bit of paid marketing or advertising  to get a few customers," then you should measure what was the cost to get  that user through paid mechanism.

但是如果你开始做一些实验，你说，“嘿，我要做一点有偿营销或广告来获得一些客户，”那么你应该衡量通过付费机制获得该用户的成本是多少。

So, which is literally saying, if I spent $10,000 on  Facebook or any other channel that you used and you got five customers from that  channel, how much did you pay for that? Common mistakes.

所以，字面上的意思是，如果我在Facebook或你使用的任何其他渠道上花了1万美元，而你从那个渠道获得了5个客户，你为此支付了多少钱？常见错误。

Two really common mistakes.

两个非常常见的错误。

And  this happens again and again, even in spite of like highlighting it, which is ARR  literally stands for annual recurring.

而且这种情况一次又一次地发生，尽管喜欢强调它，这是ARR字面上代表年度循环。

Recurring is the most important word.

重复是最重要的词。

Revenue.

收入。

If you don't  have a recurring business, which is you don't chat subscription, your customers are not committing  to 12 months of payment, you don't have a recurring revenue business.

如果你没有经常性业务，也就是你没有聊天订阅，你的客户没有承诺12个月的付款，你就没有经常性收入业务。

So internally, if  you start calling it ARR, everyone thinks, "Oh it's repeat business." It's not, because you  have to go back and acquire them each month or you have to work with  your customers to make sure they pay every month.

所以在内部，如果你开始称它为arr，每个人都会想，“哦，这是重复业务。”事实并非如此，因为你必须每月回去购买它们，或者你必须与你的客户合作，以确保他们每个月都付款。

So the most common mistake is  people instead of saying annual run rate, which actually is not very useful even to  gauge your business.

因此，最常见的错误是人们没有说年度运行率，这实际上对衡量你的业务也不是很有用。

If you use ARR, be absolutely sure you have recurring gravity.

如果您使用ARR，请绝对确保您具有重复性重力。

And  the second mistake people make is when they would say, "Oh yeah, it's recurring revenue,"  but actually the customer would have committed to only one time payment.

人们犯的第二个错误是，当他们说，“哦，是的，这是经常性收入，”但实际上客户只会承诺一次付款。

Or you may  have done a consulting project and it's not really clear whether they're going to pay  second month or third month, but they would still include it as MRR.

或者你可能已经做了一个咨询项目，但不清楚他们是要支付第二个月还是第三个月，但他们仍然会把它作为MRR。

It's not.

不是的。

 Make sure you're including only what's truly recurring where the customer has said, "I'm signed  up for a 12 month or a six month annual plan and this is what  I'm paying." The third is subscription.

确保您只包含真正重复出现的内容，其中客户说，“我注册了12个月或6个月的年度计划，这就是我支付的费用。”三是认购。

This is probably more relevant for consumer businesses.

这可能与消费者业务更相关。

So  if you Dollar Shave Club, Blue Apron, Athletech, there are lots of companies, especially subscription  as a service is becoming so popular in consumer right now.

所以如果你有美元剃须俱乐部，蓝色围裙，AthleTECH，有很多公司，特别是订阅服务现在消费者中变得如此受欢迎。

It's very similar to  SaaS, but it has a slight nuance.

它与SaaS非常相似，但有一些细微的差别。

So similar to SaaS because you have MRR,  which is recurring, right? You may have signed up a Netflix annual subscription.

所以类似于SaaS，因为你有MRR，这是循环的，对吗？您可能已经注册了Netflix年度订阅。

It's recurring,  it's monthly recurring.

它是循环的，它是每月循环的。

The two differences is instead of looking at ARR or any of  that, we actually say measure your monthly growth and unit churn, not dollar churn.

这两个不同之处在于，我们实际上不是看ARR或其他任何东西，而是衡量你的月度增长和单位变动，而不是美元变动。

Why  is that? Because if you're selling to companies, usually your subscription is more value, right?  It's like they're paying two thousand five thousand dollars so there if you lose a  customer, the impact on revenue is a lot.

这是为什么？因为如果你向公司销售，通常你的订阅更有价值，对吗？这就像他们支付了两千五千美元，所以如果你失去了一个客户，对收入的影响是很大的。

So you should really look at revenue  churn.

所以你真的应该看看收入的变化。

If you look at Netflix, everybody pays 7 or $10 per month.

如果你看看Netflix，每个人每个月都要支付7到10美元。

So it's  about volume of customers, which is why we say pay attention to growth because you  need to make sure that the number of users using Netflix continues to increase.

所以这关乎客户数量，这就是为什么我们说要关注增长，因为你需要确保使用Netflix的用户数量继续增加。

And  you measure unit churn because if you lost a customer who's paying $10 it's $10  but if he lost a thousand customers paying $10 each, that's significant.

你测量单位流动率，因为如果你失去了一个支付10美元的客户，那就是10美元，但如果他失去了1000个每个支付10美元的客户，这很重要。

Right? So which  is why we say measured grows unit churn was as if you're a SaaS business  selling to companies, measure revenue churn.

对吗？因此，这就是为什么我们说衡量增长单位流失就好像你是一家向公司销售的SaaS企业，衡量收入流失。

And paid CAC is very similar like the last  time, which is make sure if you're spending paid marketing, measure the cost associated with  acquiring those users.

付费CAC与上一次非常相似，那就是确保如果你花费了付费营销，衡量与获得这些用户相关的成本。

Don't do it on a blended basis.

不要在混合的基础上做。

So when you are at  this stage, you will tend to grow in spikes.

因此，当你在这个阶段，你将倾向于成长为钉子。

So this month you may grow  80%, next month you would grow 10%, next month you may grow another 90% right?  That's natural because you're learning, you're iterating and you're trying to figure out what really  resonates with the user.

所以这个月你可能会增长80%，下个月你会增长10%，下个月你可能会再增长90%，对吗？这是很自然的，因为你在学习，你在迭代，你在试图找出真正与用户产生共鸣的东西。

So what's really important is to make sure that since launch,  since the month you started acquiring users, you measure compounded monthly growth rate.

因此，真正重要的是确保自发布以来，从您开始获取用户的那个月开始，您衡量的是复合月度增长率。

So which  is low, the current month divided by the first month and decrease that growth rate  proportionately for the number of months since launch.

所以哪个是低的，当前月份除以第一个月，然后按比例降低自发布以来的月数的增长率。

What founders often do as mistake is  they would just do the average.

创始人经常犯的错误是，他们只会做普通的事情。

So they would do 90% this month plus 10%  second month plus 80% third month.

所以他们这个月要做90%，第二个月再加10%，第三个月再加80%。

What happens with averages? It makes your growth look  good because you had some spikes.

平均数会发生什么？它让你的生长看起来很好，因为你有一些尖峰。

You want to be true to yourself because these  won't be problems when you are two or three people team but hopefully you all  will scale and we'll start hitting 10 people team.

你想要真实地面对自己，因为当你是两三个人的团队时，这些不会成为问题，但希望你们都能扩大规模，我们将开始打击10人的团队。

And then when you set goals,  someone will be very happy that it's 50% growth rate.

然后，当你设定目标时，有人会非常高兴，因为它的增长率是50%。

But that's because you're measuring  growth wrong.

但那是因为你对增长的衡量是错误的。

The next is transactional businesses.

其次是交易业务。

This is probably more new, new in the  sense that's happened in the last 8 to 10 years.

这可能是更新的，在过去8到10年中发生的意义上的新的。

And again you'll see that  with Stripe, PayPal, Coinbase, Bracks, a lot of Fintech companies especially fall in this category.

再一次，你会看到，随着条纹，贝宝，Coinbase，Bracks，很多金融科技公司特别属于这一类别。

 So what is a transactional company? Which is if you're in the safe and tech  or payment space, you probably process a lot of payments volume, right? Let's take Stripe  for example, they provide the payments for more startups.

那么什么是交易型公司呢？也就是说，如果你在安全和技术或支付领域，你可能会处理大量的支付量，对吗？让我们以条纹为例，他们为更多的初创企业提供付款。

And so every startup's payment volume  goes to Stripe.

因此，每个初创公司的支付额都流向了“条纹”。

That's the transactional business.

这就是交易业务。

But Stripe collects a fee for the transaction.

但是条纹是为交易收取费用的。

 So if you're a type of business that processes someone else payments volume, then you  should put yourself in the transactional bucket.

因此，如果你是一种处理别人付款数量的企业，那么你应该把自己放在交易桶中。

So the gross transaction volume is the TPV  or the Total Payments Volume that flows through the platform.

因此，总交易量是通过平台流动的TPV或总支付量。

So Stripe had 30 customers  at your stage, and all 30 customers were processing say 100 million in TPV, but  it all went through Stripe, that's TPV.

所以条纹在你的阶段有30个客户，所有30个客户都在处理，比如说1亿TPV，但所有的都通过了条纹，也就是TPV。

But that's not revenue.

但这不是收入。

Revenue is what goes  to your bank account.

收入是进入你的银行账户的东西。

So that's your cut, which is why it's called net revenue.

这就是你的分成，这就是为什么它被称为净收入。

 So the portion of transaction volume that you make, so Stripe would say, "Hey, I  charge two and a half percent for the payment volume that flows through my platform,"  the two and a half percent is the net revenue that they take.

所以你做的交易量的一部分，所以斯特里奇会说，“嘿，我对流经我的平台的支付量收取2.5%的费用，”这2.5%是他们的净收入。

If you're  in the transactional business, it's very common that you'll have lots of customers, right? So  within a [inaudible] , you could even have 1,000, 2,000 customers.

如果你从事交易业务，你会有很多客户是很常见的，对吧？所以在一个[听不到]的范围内，你甚至可以有1，000到2，000个客户。

Then the important metric  to track is user retention because you want to make sure that six months after  they are using you or 12 months after they've started using you, hopefully they are  still using you.

然后，要跟踪的重要指标是用户保留率，因为您希望确保他们在使用您后6个月或开始使用您12个月后，希望他们仍在使用您。

Why? Because you are powering their platform.

为什么？因为你在为他们的平台提供动力。

Unless they've gone out of  business, there should be no reason they're not using your platform.

除非他们已经停业，否则他们没有理由不使用你的平台。

How are they doing  business? Like imagine if someone stopped using Stripe.

他们的生意怎么样？比如想象一下如果有人停止使用条纹。

Well, are they out of business or  who is processing their payments? So that's why it's really important to measure your cohort  retention on a monthly basis if you are a transaction business.

嗯，他们是歇业了还是谁在处理他们的付款？这就是为什么如果你是一家交易公司，按月衡量你的队列保留率是非常重要的。

And paid CAC is  very similar to what, in all cases it's the same thing, just measure from paid  channels.

而且付费CAC非常类似于什么，在所有情况下都是一样的，只是从付费渠道测量。

But again, as I said, hopefully none of you are doing paid marketing.

但是，正如我所说的，希望你们没有人做付费营销。

So  what is the common mistake here? Confusing gross transaction volume to net revenue.

那么，这里常见的错误是什么呢？混淆总交易量和净收入。

As I  said, if you are processing 100 million in transaction volume, that's not net revenue.

正如我所说的，如果你正在处理1亿的交易量，那不是净收入。

That's  not the cash that hits your bank.

那不是你银行里的现金。

Two and a half percent of the a  hundred million hits your bank.

一亿美元中的百分之二点五击中了你的银行。

That's a much smaller number, so you should really make  sure what you call revenue is just transaction volume.

这是一个小得多的数字，所以你真的应该确保你所谓的收入只是交易量。

And I've often seen founders here  sometime come up with like, "Oh, but I process the volume.

我经常看到这里的创始人有时想出这样的话，“哦，但是我处理卷。

That's my revenue." No  excuses.

那是我的收入“没有借口。

Net revenue is literally the cash you make in the bank and then user  retention is a cohort metric.

从字面上看，净收入是你在银行赚到的现金，然后用户保留是一个队列指标。

It's not one number.

不是一个号码。

It's not like, "Oh, I retain  30% of my users." That means nothing to us, right? Even for you, it should  not.

这不是说，“哦，我保留了30%的用户。”这对我们毫无意义，对吧？即使对你来说也不应该。

Because if you're providing payments, you should say, "Well, 40% of my customers have  used it consistently for the 12 months since they joined us." Well, that's a better  metric.

因为如果你提供付款，你应该说，“好吧，我的客户中有40%在加入我们后的12个月里一直在使用它。”嗯，这是个更好的衡量标准。

Next is marketplace.

其次是市场。

Again, this is more, it looks like transaction but it's different.

再一次，这是更多，它看起来像交易，但它是不同的。

 It's typically used by consumer companies.

它通常被消费公司使用。

So Airbnb, Ebay are all good examples of marketplace.

所以Airbnb，eBay都是市场的好例子。

 What's a marketplace? You have two sites.

什么是市场？你有两个网站。

So in Airbnb you have hosts and guests.

所以在Airbnb你有主人和客人。

 Guests go to the platform, select a room, book it, the host is happy.

客人走到站台上，选择一个房间，预订，主人很高兴。

That's  a marketplace.

那是个集市。

So what are the three or four metrics that matter here? GMV, right?  So when the guest books the room, the host might say it's $100 per night.

那么，这里最重要的三个或四个指标是什么？GMV，对吧？所以当客人预订房间时，主人可能会说每晚100美元。

 And so the $100 per night, say they stay to two nights, it's $200.

所以每晚100美元，假设他们住两晚，就是200美元。

That  $200 GMV that Airbnb can record.

Airbnb可以记录的200美元GMV。

But that's not natural venue because Airbnb doesn't make  the full $200.

但这不是自然的地点，因为Airbnb不能赚到全部200美元。

Airbnb probably makes 12% of that, right? So 12% off that $200  is what you'd classify as net revenue.

Airbnb可能占其中的12%，对吧？所以这200美元就是你所说的净收入的12%。

Two other metrics, again, similar to the other  morals that we talked about you want to track here is compounded monthly growth rate.

另外两个指标，再次，类似于我们谈到的其他道德，你想在这里跟踪的是复合月度增长率。

 If you see this is a more important metric for consumer businesses, right? Because volume  of consumers matter and therefore it's really important to track your monthly growth rate in  a compounded way so you can keep yourself honest how you're growing.

如果你看到这对消费企业来说是一个更重要的指标，对吗？因为消费者的数量很重要，因此以一种复合的方式跟踪你的每月增长率是非常重要的，这样你就可以让自己诚实地了解你的增长情况。

And similarly, when  it comes to consumer businesses, you should pay attention to user retention, not necessarily dollar  retention because the volume of users matter.

同样，当涉及到消费业务时，您应该注意用户保留，而不一定是美元保留，因为用户量很重要。

So here you would say, "What percentage of  customers came back to Airbnb or Airbnb retained 6 months or 12 months from now?"  Now in Airbnb's case, how often do people travel? Does anyone want to take a  guess? Was that once a year? Very good.

所以在这里你会说，“从现在起6个月或12个月后，回到Airbnb或Airbnb保留的客户百分比是多少？”在Airbnb的案例中，人们多久旅行一次？有人想猜猜吗？是一年一次吗？非常好。

So how should they track when should  they be happy, when should they be sad? Once a year? Yes.

那么，他们应该如何跟踪他们什么时候应该高兴，什么时候应该悲伤？一年一次？是。

So if you  imagine when Airbnb was going through YC and they could see their cohort repetition once  a year, how are you going to know you're building a good business? They had  to wait 12 months.

所以，如果你想象一下，当Airbnb通过YC时，他们可以看到他们的队列每年重复一次，你怎么知道你正在建立一个良好的企业呢？他们不得不等12个月。

Will you wait 12 months to check whether your customers are  coming back? No.

您会等待12个月以检查您的客户是否会回来吗？没有。

So this is the where you have to get creative.

所以这就是你必须发挥创造力的地方。

And the  way to get creative is reflect on your user behavior.

而获得创意的方法就是反映在你的用户行为上。

So if you're going to  book something, hopefully someone who's traveling is not booking the day before they're traveling.

所以，如果你要预订一些东西，希望正在旅行的人不会在他们旅行的前一天预订。

They  start doing research six months before.

他们六个月前就开始做研究了。

And so Airbnb studied that.

因此Airbnb对此进行了研究。

And so what they  would track is if you as users came back to at least search for a  city or a booking six months.

因此，他们会跟踪的是，如果你作为用户回来至少搜索一个城市或预订六个月。

In this stage of your startup, what's most important  is to really be truthful and honest about how you want the users to behave  and come up with those retention metrics to measure if your business is really healthy.

在你创业的这个阶段，最重要的是真正真实和诚实地告诉你希望用户如何表现，并提出那些留任指标来衡量你的业务是否真的健康。

 And are you seeing what you want to see from your users? So what's the  common mistake here? This was especially acute for Airbnb because they didn't pay anything for  demand site, right? They had a brilliant value proposition.

您是否看到了您希望从用户那里看到的内容？那么这里常见的错误是什么呢？这对于Airbnb来说尤其尖锐，因为他们没有为需求网站支付任何费用，对吗？他们有一个卓越的价值主张。

They were really good designers, very  good storytellers.

他们真的是很好的设计师，非常好的讲故事的人。

Demand, they didn't pay anything, but they had to pay to acquire a  host because guess what? No one was ready to let their homes to strangers.

需求，他们没有支付任何费用，但他们必须支付获得一个主机，因为你猜怎么着？没有人愿意把自己的房子租给陌生人。

So  they had to work hard, which was they had to put advertising around events.

所以他们必须努力工作，也就是他们必须在活动周围投放广告。

So  they had to spend few dollars on acquiring hosts pretty much, very early on.

所以他们很早就花了很少的钱来收购主机。

So  the number one mistake founders tend to do here is, you're acquiring a bunch of  users organically and some users through paid and you'll blend everything.

因此，创始人在这里往往会犯的第一个错误是，你正在有机地获得一大批用户，一些用户通过付费获得，你会把一切都融合在一起。

You'll say, "I acquired  a hundred users this month and so my CAC was 12," but what had happened  was if you truly measured who you acquired from paid advertising channel, it could be  as high as 70 and so you have to ask yourself, is it sustainable? Are  you really seeing the ROI in paid channels? So if you are in an unusual  situation like Airbnb there, your business frequency is not very high because people use once  a year and you have to pay to acquire hosts.

你会说，“我这个月获得了100个用户，所以我的CAC是12，”但是发生了什么，如果你真正衡量你从付费广告渠道获得了谁，它可能高达70，所以你必须问自己，它是可持续的吗？你真的在付费渠道看到了投资回报吗？因此，如果您处于像Airbnb这样的不寻常情况下，您的业务频率并不是很高，因为人们每年使用一次，并且您必须支付购买主机的费用。

It's really important to pay  attention to where your money is going and whether you're getting a good ROI from  that.

关注你的钱都花到哪里去了，以及你是否从中获得了良好的投资回报，这一点真的很重要。

Ecommerce.

电子商务。

Ecommerce is literally you have certain goods to sell, you're selling them online,  people are ordering it, Warby Parker, Bonobos, MiMi box, a lot of them.

电子商务的字面意思是你有某些商品要出售，你在网上销售它们，人们在订购它，Warby Parker，Bonobos，Mimi box，很多这样的东西。

That's what  we would characterize as eCommerce, which is you make the products or source the products,  but ultimately it's your brand and someone's coming to the brand to purchase it.

这就是我们所说的电子商务，也就是你制造产品或采购产品，但最终这是你的品牌，有人会来购买它。

So  here again, it's a consumer business.

所以在这里，这是一项消费业务。

You track monthly revenue.

你跟踪每月收入。

Notice there's no recurring, no  subscription, it's just revenue because people might buy a product that's mundane and not buy  it next month, right? So it's monthly revenue because it's consumable business.

注意，没有重复，没有订阅，这只是收入，因为人们可能会购买一个普通的产品，而下个月不会购买，对吗？所以这是每月的收入，因为它是消费品业务。

Again, very important  to track a component monthly growth rate.

同样，跟踪组件月度增长率非常重要。

For eCommerce, even from day one, it's important  to track your gross margin because you either make the good or you're sourcing it  and branding it under your name.

对于电子商务来说，即使从第一天开始，追踪你的毛利率是很重要的，因为你要么是制造商品，要么是在你的名下采购并打上品牌。

So it's important to understand what it takes, what  is your cost to get the good so that you're making some profit on a  per product basis.

所以重要的是要了解它需要什么，你的成本是多少，这样你就可以在每个产品的基础上获得一些利润。

And it's more important for eCommerce because it's not a recurring business,  right? So you have to make sure that you're able to make money on a  per transaction basis.

而且它对电子商务更重要，因为它不是一个经常性的业务，对吗？所以你必须确保你能够在每笔交易的基础上赚钱。

So which is why gross margin is important to track.

因此，这就是为什么毛利率是重要的跟踪。

Paid CAC  very similar to all the other examples.

付费CAC非常类似于所有其他示例。

Common mistake, gross profit for eCommerce is not  accounting for all costs.

常见的错误是，电子商务的毛利并没有考虑到所有的成本。

Now Amazon does a great job of this and people often  say, "Oh yeah, they have very thin margins," but actually it's net margin of all  costs.

现在亚马逊在这方面做得很好，人们经常说，“哦，是的，他们的利润率非常低，”但实际上这是所有成本的净利润率。

And so if there's high volume, net margin times high volume is a pretty  good business which you can use to funnel for future investments.

因此，如果有高成交量，净利润率乘以高成交量是一项非常好的业务，你可以用它来为未来的投资提供资金。

So the common mistake  we see here is in eCommerce as people would say, "Oh." Say I bought a  clip and we know the cost of the clip is $10 they wouldn't include shipping  costs, they wouldn't include customer processing costs, they wouldn't include payment processing costs.

因此，我们在这里看到的常见错误是电子商务，因为人们会说，“哦。”假设我买了一个剪辑，我们知道剪辑的成本是10美元，他们不会包括运输成本，他们不会包括客户处理成本，他们不会包括支付处理成本。

All that  is important because if you don't include those costs, you're probably pricing it wrong.

所有这一切都很重要，因为如果你不包括这些成本，你可能会定价错误。

And  so it's so important that you're pricing it wrong pretty much from first transaction.

所以这是如此重要，以至于从第一次交易开始，你的定价就很大程度上是错误的。

Advertising,  we see far fewer companies in the advertising space these days.

广告，我们这些天在广告领域看到的公司要少得多。

But if you happen  to be in that space, then you know the common companies that are analogs for  you are Snapchat, Twitter, Reddit, they all have a huge social network that come to  their site for different reasons.

但如果你碰巧在那个领域，那么你就会知道与你类似的常见公司是Snapchat，Twitter，Reddit，他们都有一个巨大的社交网络，出于不同的原因来到他们的网站。

But the primary monetization model is advertisers advertise there and  the companies make money from advertisers.

但主要的货币化模式是广告商在那里做广告，公司从广告商那里赚钱。

So at this stage, because you probably will never  be monetizing if you're in the advertising business, it's all about the users.

因此，在这个阶段，因为如果你从事广告业务，你可能永远不会货币化，所以这一切都是关于用户的。

And so  when it comes to users, there are really only three things that matter.

因此，当涉及到用户时，真正重要的只有三件事。

Daily active,  monthly active, percent logged in.

每日活动、每月活动、登录百分比。

So who are the users who use your app daily,  monthly active? Who use it monthly? And then percent logged in is actively logged in  using a username and password.

那么谁是每天，每月活跃使用你的应用程序的用户呢？谁每月使用它？然后使用用户名和密码主动登录百分比。

The common mistake, and I'll give many examples of this,  not defining what active means.

常见的错误，我将给出很多例子，没有定义什么是活动。

So there was a company, I think three or four  years ago, that would put it a daily active user metric.

因此，我认为在三四年前，有一家公司会将其作为每日活跃用户指标。

And I remember asking  them, "What is active?" And I had some sense of like maybe put somebody who  had read, engaged, whatever, and this founder answered, "Well, those are the emails I sent."  That's not active.

我记得我问他们，“什么是活跃的？”我有一种感觉，可能会让某人读过书，订婚，无论什么，这位创始人回答说，“好吧，这些就是我发送的电子邮件。”那不是活动的。

Active, again, it goes back to the Airbnb example.

ACTIVE，再次返回到Airbnb示例。

You should define  what you want your users to behave like when using your app.

您应该定义您希望用户在使用您的应用程序时的行为。

So if you're  building a news app, does it mean reading counts as active? Does it mean commenting  counts as active? You should define that really well.

那么，如果你正在构建一个新闻应用程序，这是否意味着阅读被算作活跃的？这是不是意味着评论就算活跃了？你应该定义得很好。

And so if you don't define  that, you could be building something that has no stickiness and probably you're going to  have users that are winding down pretty quickly and it's not worth it, right? So  make sure you really define what active is and hold yourselves to that metric.

所以，如果你不定义它，你可能会构建一些没有粘性的东西，可能你会有用户很快就会退出，这不值得，对吧？所以，确保你真的定义了什么是活动，并保持自己的标准。

The  other one is hardware.

另一个是硬件。

It's again, very similar to eCommerce because at the end of  the day they're selling a device.

同样，这与电子商务非常相似，因为在一天结束时，他们出售的是一种设备。

So if your Fitbit, GoPro, [inaudible 00:22:41], we'd say  you're in the hardware bucket.

所以如果你的Fitbit，GoPro，[听不见的00：22：41]，我们会说你在硬件桶里。

As you can see, it's very similar to eCommerce where  you look at monthly revenue, compounded monthly growth rate.

正如你所看到的，这与电子商务非常相似，你可以看到月度收入，复合月度增长率。

You look at gross margin really  carefully.

你真的很仔细地看毛利率。

Hopefully you're making profit from day one and then paid gap.

希望你能从第一天开始盈利，然后支付差距。

Okay, so those  are the nine business models.

好的，这就是九种商业模式。

And one last thing I'd leave you with before I  open it up to questions is common mistakes.

在我对问题敞开心扉之前，我想留给你们的最后一件事就是常见的错误。

So common mistakes is, you've heard this  and you've probably read this in so many blogs, charge that look up into the  writer.

所以常见的错误是，你听过这句话，你可能在很多博客上读过这句话，收费，看看作者。

Brilliant.

非常出色。

Well, but accumulative charts are always up and to the right.

嗯，但是累积图总是向上和向右的。

Do not  have any com, there is no rational in the world to have accumulative charts.

没有任何COM，世界上没有理性的有累积图。

So  I don't know a single company at scale that shows accumulative charts.

因此，我不知道有哪一家公司在规模上显示了累积图表。

So do not  take accumulative chart.

所以不要拿累积图。

Second thing I've seen is not labeling Y axis.

我看到的第二件事是没有标记Y轴。

As I said,  you're going to scale even if you hit five or seven users.

正如我所说的，即使你达到了五七个用户，你也会进行扩展。

If you don't  know what the Y axis label is, and if the charts look like straight vertical  bars, it means nothing.

如果您不知道Y轴标签是什么，并且如果图表看起来像垂直直条，则没有任何意义。

Third is changing Y axis scale.

三是改变Y轴比例。

This is something I never  understood, but quite a few of them do it, which is X axis starts at  zero and Y axis starts at safety.

这是我从未理解过的事情，但他们中有相当多的人这样做，即X轴从零开始，Y轴从安全处开始。

Those things don't really show how well you're  growing.

这些东西并不能真正显示出你的成长有多好。

Show your problems, by the way, no YC startup had a chart straight up  and to the right.

显示你的问题，顺便说一句，没有YC初创公司有一个直立的图表和右边。

No one did and the most successful companies didn't either.

没有人这样做，最成功的公司也没有。

So  I think the most important thing is to really be honest, measure and fix things,  right? It's okay to go down sometimes.

所以我认为最重要的事情是真正的诚实，衡量和修复事情，对吗？有时候下去也没关系。

And also usually we say don't show only  percentage charts.

而且通常我们说不要只显示百分比图表。

It's very important that whatever you're measuring, whether it's gross revenue churn, monthly  growth, be clear about the absolute number and the percentage relative to the absolute number.

无论你在衡量什么，无论是总收入波动，还是月度增长，都要清楚绝对数和相对于绝对数的百分比，这一点非常重要。

 We also had done detailed posts on metrics while I was at a16z.

当我在a16z时，我们也做了关于指标的详细帖子。

So I've  included two links there if anyone wants to look at it.

所以如果有人想看的话，我在这里加入了两个链接。

But at your stage,  only three or four metrics matter.

但是在您的阶段，只有三到四个指标是重要的。

If anything you took from here, hopefully you fit  into one of these nine business models.

如果你从这里拿走了任何东西，希望你适合这九种商业模式中的一种。

You can start with two or three of  these metrics for each business model and that itself will be a great headstart for  all of you.

您可以从每个业务模型的两三个指标开始，这本身对你们所有人来说都是一个很好的开端。

Thank you.

谢谢。

Yup.

是的。

Questions.
Speaker 2:I have two quick questions.

问题。演讲者2：我有两个简短的问题。

On the enterprise side, but you almost equate the bookings  to accrual accounting.

在企业方面，但您几乎将预订等同于权责发生制会计。

Is that a one to one matching right there?
Speaker 1:Yeah.

那是一对一的匹配吗？扬声器1：是的。

So the question is can we map bookings to accrual accounting, right? Yeah.

所以问题是我们能否将预订映射到权责发生制会计，对吗？嗯。

I  think that's not, I mean, the purpose of tracking bookings was as revenue is not  from an accounting standpoint, it's from how do you gauge your business, meaning bookings as  future revenue, right? So all you're saying is, "I have signed a contract for $a  hundred thousand.

我认为这不是，我的意思是，跟踪预订的目的不是从会计的角度来看收入，而是从你如何衡量你的业务，意味着预订作为未来的收入，对吧？所以你所说的就是，“我已经签了一份十万美元的合同。

I am not ready to launch for them until two months from now."  But you know that it's future bookings because it's all signed and the customer has  committed to working with you.

我要到两个月后才准备为他们推出。“但你知道这是未来的预订，因为它都已签署，并且客户已承诺与您合作。

So you say it's a hundred K and then, but  you're not starting to deliver service until two months from now, which means you can't  recognize revenue.

所以你说是100K然后，但你直到两个月后才开始提供服务，这意味着你不能确认收入。

So it's only a measure to manage your business internally.

因此，这只是一种内部管理业务的措施。

So you know  that this is coming in the pipeline.

所以你知道这是即将到来的管道。

This is where my team's resources is going  to go.

这就是我的团队的资源要去的地方。

But if I want to hit the goal of 200K by the end  of the year, how should I, maybe you need to go find one more customer  or accelerate launching your service, which is most likely the case in the phase that  you are in, which is why am I waiting two months to launch this? What  can I do to launch it tomorrow?
Speaker 2:And the second quick question was for community business, we can pick from a couple  of different things within these nine verticals and business model.

但是如果我想在年底之前达到200K的目标，我应该怎么做，也许你需要多找一个客户或者加快推出你的服务，这很可能是你所处阶段的情况，这就是为什么我等了两个月才推出这个？我明天要怎么做才能启动它？演讲者2：第二个快速问题是关于社区业务，我们可以从这九个垂直市场和业务模式中选择几个不同的东西。

Is there something that you  are recommending for a community business to track early on before you decide business model?
Speaker 1:I think that the question was really what should we track for community business? I  put community business whether your business model is advertising or not in that category.

在你决定商业模式之前，有没有什么东西是你推荐给社区企业早期跟踪的？演讲者1：我认为真正的问题是我们应该跟踪社区业务的内容？无论你的商业模式是不是广告，我都把社区商业放在那一类。

So  really what he should be tracking is define who your active user is and what  you want that user to do.

因此，他真正应该跟踪的是定义谁是您的活动用户以及您希望该用户做什么。

So daily active users and monthly active and track  weekly how they're doing.
Speaker 3:[inaudible]
Speaker 1:yeah.

因此，每天的活跃用户和每月的活跃用户每周都会跟踪他们的情况。扬声器3：[听不见]扬声器1：是的。

You know, most businesses evolve to different business models over time., right? What's most  important is what is your short-term focus? So if you're short-term is like for the  next year or two, which is about finding product market fit in your transactional business,  then that's the area you want to start with.
Speaker 3:[inaudible]
Speaker 1:Yes, absolutely.

你知道，随着时间的推移，大多数企业都会演变成不同的商业模式。对吗？最重要的是你的短期重点是什么？所以，如果你是短期的，比如未来一两年，这是关于在你的交易业务中找到适合的产品市场，那么这就是你想要开始的领域。扬声器3：[听不见]扬声器1：是的，当然。

So the question was what should we talk to for investors.

所以问题是我们应该为投资者谈些什么。

At this  stage, honestly, the bet is only on two or three things, which is you as  the founder.

在这个阶段，老实说，赌注只有两三件事，那就是你作为创始人。

What unique insight do you have that you're building this and can this  be a big company? That's it.

你有什么独特的见解，你正在建设这个，这能成为一个大公司吗？就这样。

And so don't overcomplicate this.
Speaker 4:Do you have any suggestion [inaudible 00:28:17]?
Speaker 1:Yes.

所以不要把事情搞得太复杂了。演讲者4：你有什么建议[听不见的00：28：17]？演讲者1：是的。

Yeah.

嗯。

So great question.

问得好。

Again, as I said, it's very easy to get caught  up in what do investors want to see.

再说一次，正如我所说的，投资者很容易被投资者想要看到的东西缠住。

But the most important thing is you  know more about the business than anyone.

但最重要的是你比任何人都更了解这个行业。

And so it's about what should you track  to make sure your business is healthy.

因此，它是关于你应该跟踪什么，以确保你的业务是健康的。

So the two things as founders you should  track very early on is burn, right? Because you're spending cash.

所以，作为创始人，你应该很早就跟踪的两件事就是烧伤，对吗？因为你在花钱。

So you should always  know, don't run out of money.

所以你应该永远知道，不要把钱花光。

So there's no excuse for running out of money.

所以没有理由把钱花光。

 So make sure you do your P&L quarterly so that you're tracking your burn and  you know that there's enough money in the bank to at least operate the company  for another six to nine months.

所以，确保你每季度做一次损益表，这样你就可以追踪你的烧伤情况，而且你知道银行里有足够的钱至少可以让公司再运营6到9个月。

Two is related to expenses.

二是与费用有关。

It's the gross margin,  especially if you're in business categories that are eCommerce or consumer related.

这是毛利率，特别是如果你在电子商务或消费者相关的商业类别中。

Then they do  pay attention.

那么他们确实注意了。

It's important for founders to pay attention to gross margin which is on  a per transaction basis.

对于创始人来说，关注每笔交易的毛利率是很重要的。

Am I making money or not? Because if net you're not  making money then it's, do you have line of sight when you would make money  because if you don't then you should really question is that a business to be  built? But I'd suspect it's quite early right now, which is why I say focus  on getting the users and how do you monetize? That's the first step.
Speaker 2:For businesses has a model kind of like take an ancestry.com where people sign up.

我到底有没有赚钱？因为如果你没有赚钱，那就是，当你赚钱的时候，你有没有视线，因为如果你没有，那么你真的应该问那是一个要建立的企业吗？但我怀疑现在还为时过早，这就是为什么我说专注于获得用户和如何赚钱？这是第一步演讲者2：对于企业来说，有一种模式，就像人们注册的ancestry.com。

 They then report and they may want to come back and refer to it later  but there's new addition revenue for what they originally purchased.

然后他们会报告，他们可能想回来参考它，但他们最初购买的东西有新的额外收入。

Would you do that sort  of eCommerce business? Would you also monitor their-
Speaker 1:Yeah, I think you should do both.

你会做那样的电子商务业务吗？你也会监控他们吗-演讲者1：是的，我认为你应该两个都做。

But I would record revenue as just the  revenue for that month because it was purchased only for that month.

但我会将收入记录为当月的收入，因为它只在那个月购买。

And then you  just figure out like how Airbnb did, which is what's the behavior you expect? Do  you expect them to come back once a year? If so, are they and what  percentage of them are coming back? Yeah, I'll go to this site.
Speaker 5:[inaudible]
Speaker 1:Yeah.

然后你就像Airbnb做的那样弄清楚，你期望的行为是什么？你希望他们一年回来一次吗？如果是的话，他们有吗？他们中有多少人会回来？是的，我会去这个网站。扬声器5：[听不见]扬声器1：是的。

So great question.

问得好。

And this is why I brought up the Airbnb host example,  right? The only thing that I would say that's probably most important is to measure  the paid acquisition cost of bringing that supplier in.

这就是为什么我提出了Airbnb主机示例，对吧？我想说的唯一件事可能是最重要的，就是衡量把那个供应商带进来的付费收购成本。

Because in most marketplaces it's actually  really hard to get the demand side, which is the users, right? And if you  get enough business for the supply, the supply will stay.

因为在大多数市场中，实际上很难获得需求方，即用户，对吗？如果你有足够的生意来供应，供应就会保持不变。

And especially at this point,  again, if you are three years out and you have scaled and you at like  20, 30 million GMV, the answer to your question is different.

特别是在这一点上，再一次，如果你是三年后，你已经扩展，你在20，3000万GMV，对你的问题的答案是不同的。

At this point it's  about how do I get both sides organically as far as possible.

在这一点上，它是关于如何让双方尽可能有机地。

If you have  to spend on the supply side for a little bit, okay, but try experiments every  now and then.

如果你不得不在供应方面花一段时间，好的，但要时不时地尝试实验。

But when you're trying experiment, the most important thing to measure is  what's your paid acquisition cost because hopefully it's not so much that your born goes  out of back so that those are the two that really matter.
Speaker 3:Wait, you said about enterprise business that you know on day one we won't be  selling to Facebooks and Googles.

但当你尝试实验时，最重要的是衡量你的付费收购成本是多少，因为希望你的出生不会太多，所以这两个才是真正重要的。演讲者3：等等，你说过关于企业业务，你第一天就知道我们不会卖给Facebook和Google。

So what's your recommendation like break down the business model?  Just go down to smaller teams of individuals in the enterprise.
Speaker 1:In given an enterprise businesses, you can't really sell to Facebook from day one.

那么，你的建议是什么，比如打破商业模式？只需到企业中较小的个人团队即可。演讲者1：在给定的企业业务中，你不可能从第一天起就向Facebook出售产品。

How  should we focus about the go to market? Should we just go to small teams?  You almost always start with small teams or a pilot, right? So when companies do  focus on enterprise, you usually start with a pilot.

我们应该如何关注市场的走向？我们是不是应该去小团队？你几乎总是从小团队或飞行员开始，对吗？因此，当公司确实专注于企业时，你通常会从试点开始。

But the pilot could be something  like it's a six month pilot or it could be a three month pilot.

但是试点可以是类似于六个月的试点，也可以是三个月的试点。

In  those cases, you don't report them as bookings or revenue.

在这些情况下，您不会将它们报告为预订或收入。

You just say it's a  pilot.

你只要说它是飞行员。

At the end of the pilot, we visit whether we can get a contract.

在试点结束时，我们访问是否可以获得合同。

 And the phase that you're in, usually you will have only one or two customers  over the course of 12 to 24 months.

在你所处的阶段，通常在12到24个月的过程中，你只会有一到两个客户。

That's okay because the ACV, if it  works out, the annual contract would be really huge and that's expected.

这没什么，因为ACV，如果它成功了，年度合同将是非常巨大的，这是预期的。

One more.
Speaker 6:Alright.

再来一个。扬声器6：好的。

I know that's probably my answers to this question but how do you determine  what a good customer acquisition cost is?
Speaker 1:Yeah, it's really hard.

我知道这可能是我对这个问题的回答，但如何确定一个好的客户获取成本是多少呢？演讲者1：是的，真的很难。

The good acquisition customer cost is zero.

良好的收购客户成本为零。

So let me just  say that.

所以让我这么说吧。

That's the best customer acquisition cost, especially at this stage, because if you  have built something that people really want, you will get it without spending much, right?  So at this stage it's only zero.

这是最好的客户获取成本，特别是在这个阶段，因为如果你已经建立了人们真正想要的东西，你就可以不用花很多钱就能得到它，对吧？所以在这个阶段它只是零。

As you scale, there's obviously room.

随着你的规模，显然有空间。

It's not  necessarily, the correct answer is not an absolute dollar number.

这不一定，正确的答案不是一个绝对的美元数字。

The way you look at  it is you compare your acquisition costs to the lifetime value of the customer.

你看它的方式是你比较你的收购成本和客户的终生价值。

So  if you had the customer for one year, in Airbnb's case, for example, if Airbnb  says, "Yeah, you know, this customer booked twice with me, and if they do that  every year, I make $100 from them," then you say, "I can, you know, you  should have a five X gap." So you're willing to spend $20 to acquire, but  at this stage the answer is zero.


因此，如果你有客户一年，在Airbnb的情况下，例如，如果Airbnb说，“是的，你知道，这个客户和我订了两次票，如果他们每年都这样做，我从他们身上赚100美元，”然后你说，“我可以，你知道，你应该有一个5倍的差距。”所以你愿意花20美元来收购，但在这个阶段，答案是零。
