# Eric Migicovsky - How to Talk to Users

Eric Migicovsky:Hi everyone.

埃里克·米吉科夫斯基：大家好。

My name is Eric Migicovsky.

我叫埃里克·米吉科夫斯基。

I'm a partner here at YC.

我是YC的合伙人

I actually  started a company that went through Y Combinator back in 2011.

实际上，我在2011年创办了一家通过Y Combinator的公司。

I started a company  called Pebble.

我创办了一家叫Pebble的公司。

We made one of the first smart watches.

我们制造了最早的智能手表之一。

I am really excited to  be here to talk about talking to users because this is one of the perennial  things that you always hear about as one of the critical factors in starting a  company.

我真的很兴奋能在这里谈论与用户交谈，因为这是你经常听到的作为创办公司的关键因素之一的事情之一。

The best founders maintain a direct connection to their users throughout the lifespan of  their entire company.

最好的创始人在整个公司的生命周期中都与用户保持着直接的联系。

They maintain a direct connection because they need to extract information from  their users at all different stages of running their company.

他们保持直接连接，因为他们需要在运营公司的所有不同阶段从用户那里提取信息。

Oftentimes, people think that they're  the CEO or they're the CTO.

通常，人们认为自己是CEO或CTO。

They're the technical product leads of the company.

他们是公司的技术产品领导者。

They  can outsource this research to other people in their company.

他们可以将这项研究外包给公司内的其他人。

They can hire sales people,  they can hire heads of product, but at the core, the best companies are the  ones where the founders themselves maintain a direct connection to their users.

他们可以雇佣销售人员，他们可以雇佣产品主管，但在核心，最好的公司是创始人自己与用户保持直接联系的公司。

If you are  the CEO, it is your job, it is in your job description, to talk to  customers.

如果你是首席执行官，这是你的工作，在你的工作描述中，与客户交谈。

So, take the time to learn how to do it well.

所以，花时间学习如何做好它。

All founders need  to participate in this process as well.

所有创始人也需要参与这个过程。

If you're the engineer, if you're the developer,  don't think that you can escape this process just because you're the person who's coding.

如果你是工程师，如果你是开发人员，不要以为你是编码的人就可以逃避这个过程。

 There's a pretty classic scene from the movie Office Space where there's an individual who  says, "I'm the person who is the go-between between engineers and users.

电影Office Space中有一个非常经典的场景，其中有一个人说，“我是工程师和用户之间的中间人。

I know how  to talk to people.

我知道怎么和人说话。

I have people skills," and that is one of the things  that you do not want to have happen at your company.

我有人际交往技能，“这是你不希望在公司发生的事情之一。

You want to make  sure that the founders and the core members of your company are the ones who  develop the skills for talking to users so you do not have to hire someone  like that to be your go-between.

你要确保公司的创始人和核心成员是那些能够发展与用户交谈的技能的人，这样你就不必雇佣这样的人来充当你的中间人了。

Talking to users is so critical, that at the  core of YC's teachings, there are only two things that you must do in order  to start your company.

与用户交谈是如此重要，在YC的教导的核心，只有两件事你必须做才能开始你的公司。

You need to code or build your product and talk to  users.

您需要编码或构建您的产品并与用户交谈。

This is easier said than done.

这说起来容易做起来难。

I want to provide today some tactical advice  on how to plan your strategy for talking to users as well as some questions  and strategies that you can use to conduct your own user interviews at the beginning  of your company.

今天，我想就如何规划与用户交谈的策略提供一些策略建议，以及一些问题和策略，您可以在公司开始时使用这些问题和策略来进行自己的用户访谈。

A lot of the advice that I'll present today is actually synthesized  fantastically in this book, actually written by a YC founder, called The Mom Test.

今天我要提出的很多建议实际上都是在这本书中进行了奇妙的综合，这本书实际上是由YC的一位创始人写的，叫做“妈妈测试”。

The  name of the book comes after the process in which we probably all go through  where we want to tell our parents about the company that we're working on, and  we think that by talking to people that love us and want to support us,  we're actually extracting good or useful information about how we could adjust or improve our  company.

这本书的名字来自于我们可能都经历过的过程，我们都想告诉父母我们正在工作的公司，我们认为通过与爱我们和想支持我们的人交谈，我们实际上是在提取关于我们如何调整或改善我们公司的好的或有用的信息。

But at its core, this is not the best way to get information.

但其核心是，这不是获取信息的最佳方式。

So,  The Mom Test, as Rob actually explains, is three common errors that we make when  we try to conduct user interviews.

所以，正如Rob实际上解释的那样，妈妈测试是我们在尝试进行用户访谈时所犯的三个常见错误。

The first problem, the first mistake that we pretty  much all make is we talk about our idea.

第一个问题，我们几乎所有人都会犯的第一个错误就是我们谈论自己的想法。

We're founders.

我们是创始人。

We love to pitch  our idea.

我们喜欢推销我们的想法。

We love to talk about the the product that we're working on.

我们喜欢谈论我们正在开发的产品。

But  during a user interview, that is not the time to be pitching the product.

但在用户访谈中，这不是推销产品的时候。

The  goal of a great user interview is to extract information from the person that you're  talking to, to extract data that will help you improve the product or improve your  marketing or improve your positioning.

伟大的用户访谈的目标是从与你交谈的人那里提取信息，提取有助于你改进产品或改进营销或改善定位的数据。

It is not to sell them on using your product.

这不是在使用你的产品时出售他们。

 So at the core of a great user interview, you need to learn about their  life.

因此，在伟大的用户访谈的核心，你需要了解他们的生活。

You need to talk about specifics around the problem area that you're trying to  solve that the user may be going through.

您需要围绕您试图解决的问题区域讨论用户可能正在经历的具体问题。

Second mistake that we pretty much all  make is we talk about hypotheticals.

我们几乎所有人都会犯的第二个错误是，我们谈论假设性的东西。

We talk about what our product could be.

我们谈论我们的产品可能是什么。

We  talk about features that we want to build.

我们谈论我们想要构建的功能。

We ask questions like, if we built  this feature, would you be interested in using it or would you be interested in  paying for it? That is wrong.

我们会问这样的问题，如果我们构建了这个功能，你是否有兴趣使用它，或者你是否有兴趣为它付费？这是不对的。

Instead, talk about specifics that have already occurred in  the user's life.

相反，谈论已经发生在用户生活中的细节。

This will give you stronger and better information in which to make  product and company changing decisions.

这将为您提供更强大、更好的信息，以便您做出产品和公司的变更决策。

You also want to talk in general about the the  user's life.

您还希望大致上谈论用户的生活。

You don't want to just talk about the specific problem, or sorry, the  specific solution that you're presenting.

你不想只谈论具体的问题，或者抱歉，你提出的具体解决方案。

Try to extract information about the users, the path that  led them to encounter that problem.

尝试提取有关用户的信息，导致他们遇到该问题的路径。

Ask them questions about their life in more broader  ways to extract context around how they arrived at this problem.

以更广泛的方式问他们关于他们生活的问题，以提取他们是如何遇到这个问题的背景。

Learn about their motivations.

了解他们的动机。

 Learn about why they got themselves into that problem in the first place.

首先了解他们为什么会陷入这个问题。

And the  third trap that we pretty much all fall into is that we talk, we talk  a lot.

我们几乎都陷入的第三个陷阱是我们说话，我们说话很多。

We're founders.

我们是创始人。

We're always pitching investors, we're pitching employees, we're trying to hire  people.

我们总是在向投资者推介，我们在推介员工，我们在努力雇佣员工。

We're trying to partner.

我们在试着合作。

So we tend to spend a lot of our time  talking.

所以我们倾向于花大量的时间交谈。

In a user interview, try to restrain your interest in talking and really listen.

在用户访谈中，试着抑制你说话的兴趣，真正倾听。

 Take notes and listen to what the user's saying because in that span of time,  the 10, 20, 30 minutes that you spend with the user, you're trying to extract  as much information as possible so that when you returned to the office and when  you returned to your cofounders, you're bringing hard data, real facts about users' lives to  the table.

做笔记，听用户说什么，因为在这段时间里，你花在用户身上的10分钟，20分钟，30分钟，你试图提取尽可能多的信息，这样当你回到办公室，当你回到你的联合创始人时，你就是在把硬数据，关于用户生活的真实事实带到台面上来。

I think that there are five great questions that everyone can ask during  their early customer interviews.

我认为，在早期的客户面试中，每个人都可以问五个很好的问题。

The first question is, what is the hardest part about doing  the thing that you're trying to solve? Let's take Dropbox for an example.

第一个问题是，做你想解决的事情最难的部分是什么？让我们以Dropbox为例。

Now, many  of you may not remember a world before Dropbox, but put yourself back in the  position of Drew, the founder of Dropbox, in 2005 when he was initially working on  the initial idea of Dropbox while studying at MIT.

现在，你们中的许多人可能不记得Dropbox之前的世界，但是让自己回到Dropbox的创始人Drew的位置，在2005年，当Drew在麻省理工学院学习时，他最初致力于Dropbox的最初想法。

Imagine you're in the computer lab  at MIT and you're sitting next to your friend.

想象一下，你在麻省理工学院的计算机实验室里，你坐在你朋友旁边。

You turn and you ask...

你转身问.。

You're  working on this project to create Dropbox and you want to learn more about how  other people are sharing files so that you can learn, are there potential users here  or what are the problems that I can help solve with this new technology? So  you turn to your friend and you ask, "What is the hardest part about working  on a group project with school computers?" You're sitting in the computer lab.

您正在从事这个项目以创建Dropbox，并且您想了解更多关于其他人如何共享文件的信息，以便您可以了解，这里是否有潜在的用户，或者我可以帮助解决哪些问题，使用这项新技术？所以你转向你的朋友，问：“用学校的电脑做小组项目最难的部分是什么？”你坐在电脑室里。

It's the  perfect context for asking that kind of question, and you begin an open ended conversation,  trying to extract information about how that person currently works on group projects together with  friends.

这是问这种问题的完美环境，你开始了一场开放式的对话，试图提取关于那个人目前如何与朋友一起从事团队项目的信息。

Hopefully, you'll learn about specific pain points that they have, like they log onto  a shared computer, they have to get their files from somewhere.

希望您能了解他们的具体痛点，就像他们登录到共享计算机上一样，他们必须从某个地方获取文件。

They may have a  network drive attached to the the university system, but they're working with someone who may  not be logged on to a university computer at that time.

他们可能有一个连接到大学系统的网络驱动器，但他们正在与当时可能没有登录到大学计算机的人一起工作。

Maybe you learn about  problems with synchronizing of shared work.

也许你会了解到共享工作的同步问题。

Maybe you're both working on the exact same document  at the exact same time.

也许你们两个在完全相同的时间处理相同的文档。

How do you currently attempt to solve that problem? In  general, the best startups are looking for problems that people face on a regular basis  or that they're painful enough to warrant solving.

您目前如何尝试解决这个问题？一般来说，最好的初创公司都在寻找人们经常面临的问题，或者是那些痛苦到足以值得解决的问题。

This question can help confirm for you  whether the problem that you're working on is actually one that real users feel is  a pain point, feel is something that they actively want to solve in their life.

这个问题可以帮助你确认你正在处理的问题是否真的是一个真正的用户感觉到的痛点，感觉是他们在生活中积极想要解决的东西。

 The second question, to the point that I was making earlier about trying to get  to specifics rather than hypotheticals, is to ask the question, tell me about the last  time that you encountered this problem.

第二个问题，就是我之前提出的关于试图得到细节而不是假设的问题，是问这个问题，告诉我你最后一次遇到这个问题的时间。

The goal of this question is actually to extract  context around the circumstances in which the user encountered that problem.

这个问题的目标实际上是提取有关用户遇到该问题的环境的上下文。

For example, in the  Dropbox case, you may be talking to your friend and learn about a week ago,  a specific timeframe.

例如，在Dropbox的情况下，您可能正在与您的朋友交谈，并了解一周前的特定时间范围。

Who were they working with? Which class were they working working on?  Was this a computer science problem? Was this an English paper? Try to extract as  much information as you can about the context in which they began solving this problem  so that as you develop your product, you'll be able to actually reference real-life examples  of past problems that potential users have had, and you can overlay your solution on  top of that to see if it would have helped in that particular circumstance.

他们和谁一起工作？他们在上哪门课？这是计算机科学的问题吗？这是一份英文报纸吗？尝试提取尽可能多的关于他们开始解决此问题的上下文的信息，以便在开发产品时，您将能够实际引用潜在用户过去遇到的问题的真实示例，并且您可以在此基础上覆盖您的解决方案，以查看它在特定情况下是否会有所帮助。

The  third question is, why was this hard? Why was the circumstance in which that student  was trying to work on their shared project, their project with other folks, why was  that hard? What were the specific things that they encountered that were difficult? The reason  why you want to ask this question is because you'll hear many different things from  different people.

第三个问题是，为什么这很难？为什么那个学生试图在他们的共享项目中工作，他们的项目与其他人一起工作，为什么这很难？他们遇到的具体困难是什么？你想问这个问题的原因是你会从不同的人那里听到很多不同的事情。

Going back to the Dropbox example, you might encounter some people who say  that maybe the number one problem that they were encountering was, when they emailed files  back and forth, they ended up duplicating work because they didn't have the exact same  kind of document at the exact same time.

回到Dropbox的例子，你可能会遇到一些人说，他们遇到的头号问题可能是，当他们来回发送文件时，他们最终重复了工作，因为他们没有在完全相同的时间拥有完全相同的文档。

Maybe other people will say that they  submitted the wrong document in the end to the professor for their group project because  they had crazy strings of file version numbers on the end.

也许其他人会说，他们最终为他们的小组项目向教授提交了错误的文档，因为他们最后有一串疯狂的文件版本号。

So, the benefit from  asking this question is not just to identify the exact problem that you may begin  to solve with your solution to this problem, but you'll also begin to understand how  you market your product, how you explain to new potential users the value or the  benefits of your solution.

因此，提出这个问题的好处不仅仅是确定您可能开始用解决此问题的解决方案解决的确切问题，而且您还将开始了解如何营销您的产品，如何向新的潜在用户解释您的解决方案的价值或好处。

In general, customers don't buy what.

一般来说，顾客不买什么。

They don't buy the what.

他们不买什么。

 They buy the why.

他们买了原因。

So in the Dropbox example, they may not be excited and  overjoyed at saying, "Well, I now have this file sinking tool that can keep all  my files in sync," but by the why, they'll say, "Well, this product will help  with this exact problem that I had just two weeks ago when I was trying  to work on a student project with some of my friends." So, answers that you  get from customers to this question of why.

所以在Dropbox的例子中，他们可能不会兴奋和欣喜地说，“好吧，我现在有了这个文件沉没工具，可以保持我所有的文件同步，”但是当问到为什么，他们会说，“好吧，这个产品将帮助解决这个确切的问题，就像两周前我试图和我的一些朋友一起做一个学生项目时遇到的问题。”所以，你从客户那里得到的答案是为什么。

Why was this past problem that you  encountered so hard may actually inform your marketing or your sales copy as you build  out the rest of your product.

为什么你遇到的这个过去的问题在你构建产品的其余部分时，实际上可能会通知你的营销或销售副本。

Fourth question is, what, if anything, have you done  to try to solve this problem? One of the biggest things that I've encountered while  helping YC companies over the last few years is that if potential customers are not  already exploring potential solutions to their problem, it's possible that the problem that you're trying  to solve is not a burning enough problem for customers, for them to be even  interested in your better solution to this product.

第四个问题是，如果有的话，你做了什么来试图解决这个问题？在过去几年中，我在帮助YC公司时遇到的最大问题之一是，如果潜在客户尚未探索他们的问题的潜在解决方案，可能您试图解决的问题对客户来说并不是一个紧迫的问题，他们甚至对您对此产品的更好解决方案感兴趣。

So this question tries to get at  the root of that issue.

所以这个问题试图找出问题的根源。

Is the person who encounters this problem already trying to  solve this? In the Dropbox example, you're working on a group project or you're talking  to someone who's worked on group projects in the past.

遇到这个问题的人是不是已经在试图解决这个问题了？在Dropbox示例中，您正在处理一个团队项目，或者您正在与过去从事过团队项目的人交谈。

Try to figure out, what  tools did they experiment with? What tools did they try to use to solve this  in the past? Maybe they solved this by getting all the individuals together in one  room to work on the project with four computers so that they could talk in  real time to each other as they were working on the product.

试着弄清楚，他们用什么工具做了实验？过去他们试图用什么工具来解决这个问题？也许他们解决这个问题的方法是把所有的人聚集在一个房间里，用四台计算机来处理这个项目，这样他们就可以在处理产品的过程中实时地相互交谈。

Maybe they experimented  with email.

也许他们试验了电子邮件。

Maybe they tried setting up, as one of the top comments on Hacker  News posted during the original Dropbox launch, maybe they had set up [rsync] and they  had already solved this problem with SFTP or something like that.

也许他们试图建立，正如最初Dropbox发布时在Hacker News上发布的顶级评论之一，也许他们已经建立了[rsync]，他们已经用SFTP或类似的东西解决了这个问题。

Again, you want to  ask this question for two reasons.

同样，你想问这个问题有两个原因。

One is to figure out whether the problem that  you're solving or you're working to solve is even really something that people are already  looking for solutions to.

一个是弄清楚你正在解决的问题或者你正在努力解决的问题是否真的是人们已经在寻找解决方案的东西。

The second one is, what are the other competition out there?  What will your product be compared against as you end up rolling out your solution  and offering it to end customers? The fifth question is very tactical.

第二个问题是，市场上的其他竞争对手是什么？当您最终推出解决方案并将其提供给最终客户时，您的产品将与什么进行比较？第五个问题非常具有战术性。

What don't you  love about the solutions that you've already tried? This is the beginning of your potential  feature set.

对于你已经尝试过的解决方案，你不喜欢的是什么？这是潜在功能集的开始。

This is how you ask the...

这就是你问.。

This is how you begin understanding what  the features are that you'll build out for your better solution to the problem.

这就是您开始了解哪些特性是您将构建的更好的问题解决方案的方式。

Now,  note that this is not the question of, what features would you want out of  a new file sinking product in the Dropbox example, because that's a hypothetical question.

现在，请注意，这不是问题，在Dropbox示例中，您希望从新的文件接收产品中获得哪些功能，因为这是一个假设问题。

Users  in general are not great at identifying the next features that they want in the  product.

用户通常不擅长识别他们想要在产品中使用的下一个特性。

Just like the old Henry Ford quote, when we were developing the automobile, our  users would have wanted a faster horse rather than a car.

就像亨利·福特的那句老话，当我们开发汽车时，我们的用户会想要一匹更快的马，而不是一辆汽车。

So this question specifically  targets, what are the problems with the existing solutions that they've already tried? These are  specifics and you can begin to kind of figure out what the differential between your  new solution and the existing solutions already in the market will be.

所以这个问题特别针对的是，他们已经尝试过的现有解决方案的问题是什么？这些都是细节，你可以开始弄清楚你的新解决方案和市场上现有的解决方案之间的区别是什么。

Talking to users,  as I said before, is useful at pretty much all stages of your company.

正如我之前所说的，与用户交谈在公司的几乎所有阶段都很有用。

But  there's three critical phases to an early stage company.

但对于一个早期阶段的公司来说，有三个关键阶段。

I would define that as a  company that has not yet reached product market fit, in which talking to users would  be extremely beneficial.

我会将其定义为一家尚未达到产品市场适合度的公司，在这种情况下，与用户交谈将是非常有益的。

Those three stages are at the idea stage, before you've even begun  developing any of your product, at the prototype stage, where you have the first kind  of rough beginnings of your product, but you haven't really gotten in the hands of  any paying customers or any users yet.

这三个阶段是在构思阶段，甚至在你开始开发你的任何产品之前，在原型阶段，你有你的产品的第一种粗略的开端，但你还没有真正得到任何付费客户或任何用户的手中。

And the third one, which is after you've  launched and you're iterating towards product market fit, how do you guide that journey? I'll  talk about a few tips for each phase.

第三个，在你推出之后，你正在向产品市场发展迭代，你如何引导这个旅程呢？我将谈谈每个阶段的一些技巧。

At the idea stage, you may have  the back of a napkin idea, you may have a thought, you may be commercializing  some technology that you've been dreaming of, but you don't yet have any first users.

在创意阶段，你可能有一个餐巾纸想法的背后，你可能有一个想法，你可能正在将你一直梦想的一些技术商业化，但你还没有任何第一个用户。

 So, you need to begin finding the first people that will be interested in either  providing information about the problem that they've encountered or potentially signing up to be your  first users.

因此，您需要开始寻找第一个有兴趣提供有关他们遇到的问题的信息或潜在注册成为您的第一个用户的人。

People come to me and ask, "How can I talk and how can  I find my first users?" Honestly, some of the best companies are products or services  that are built for the founders themself.

人们来找我，问我，“我怎么说话，如何找到我的第一批用户？”老实说，一些最好的公司是为创始人自己打造的产品或服务。

So start with yourself.

所以从你自己开始。

Test your user interview  strategy on yourself.

在你自己身上测试你的用户面试策略。

Try to walk through a situation where you've encountered that problem.

试着经历一个你遇到过这个问题的情况。

The  next step after that is to talk to friends, is to talk to coworkers, to  get warm introductions.

之后的下一步就是和朋友聊天，和同事聊天，得到热情的介绍。

It doesn't take a lot of people.

不需要很多人。

You don't have to talk  to thousands of people.

你不必和成千上万的人交谈。

Every good user research strategy begins with just one or two  people.

每一个好的用户研究策略都是从一两个人开始的。

The critical feature here is executing a unbiased and detailed customer or user interview  strategy rather than just trying to pitch your idea to them.

这里的关键功能是执行无偏见和详细的客户或用户面试策略，而不是仅仅试图向他们推销您的想法。

Another cool hack that  we've seen some great success with, actually, a YC company in this batch is using  this to...

另一个很酷的黑客，我们已经看到了一些巨大的成功，实际上，这一批YC公司正在使用这一点…

A YC company in this batch is actually selling products to firefighters, and  they realize that cold email introductions was just not working, was not a way that  they could get through to customers.

这一批YC公司实际上是向消防员销售产品，他们意识到冷电子邮件介绍不起作用，不是他们能够与客户沟通的方式。

So what they did was they actually just dropped  by fire stations in person.

所以他们所做的实际上就是亲自去消防站。

They didn't even email them to say that they were  coming ahead of time.

他们甚至没有给他们发电子邮件说他们会提前来。

They just showed up and they said, "Hey, could we speak  to the fire chief? Could we talk to someone about this problem that we've got  a solution to?" And you know what? It worked great.

他们就这样出现了，他们说，“嘿，我们能和消防队长谈谈吗？我们能不能和某人谈谈这个我们已经找到解决方案的问题？”你知道吗？效果很好。

They managed to get dozens  of in-person, you know, 10 to 15 minute long meetings just by showing up.

他们仅仅通过露面就成功地获得了数十次面对面的会议，你知道，10到15分钟的会议。

So,  when in doubt, if there's a specific target customer base that you're looking to get  feedback from, just try showing up.

所以，当你有疑问的时候，如果有一个特定的目标客户群，你想从他们那里得到反馈，那就试着出现吧。

It feels a little bit weird because it feels  like you're imposing on someone.

感觉有点怪异，因为感觉像是在强加于某人。

But at the end of the day, the mindset that  I like to get into is, if you truly think that you're solving a problem  that your target customer base is facing, you'll actually be doing them a hand.

但在一天结束时，我喜欢进入的心态是，如果你真的认为你正在解决你的目标客户群面临的问题，你实际上是在帮他们。

You'll  be helping them out by taking their 15 minutes and learning more about the problem.

你将利用他们的15分钟来帮助他们，并学习更多关于这个问题的知识。

 Industry events are another great way to get a high number of new customer interactions.

行业活动是获得大量新客户互动的另一种很好的方式。

 I remember that when I was working on Pebble, we actually went to CES, which  is this large consumer electronics show in Vegas.

我记得当我在Pebble上工作的时候，我们实际上去了CES，这是一个在拉斯维加斯举行的大型消费电子产品展。

We didn't have a booth.

我们没有摊位。

We just  went in guerrilla style.

我们只是以游击队的方式去了。

We just randomly started setting up meetings with potential users and  we met them in the coffee shop outside of the conference.

我们只是随机开始与潜在用户建立会议，我们在会议外的咖啡厅遇到了他们。

We did that for  zero dollars, without any sort of marketing budget just because that was where a lot  of people in the industry were and we knew that there was a high concentration  of potential people that we could talk to.

我们做到了零美元，没有任何形式的营销预算，只是因为那里有很多人在这个行业，我们知道有一个高度集中的潜在人员，我们可以交谈。

Some tips for the stage.

一些舞台上的小贴士。

Take notes.

记笔记。

 Take detailed notes because like I said before, you'll never know until later which key  facts of these user interviews may be useful.

做详细的笔记，因为就像我之前说的，你永远不会知道这些用户访谈的哪些关键事实可能是有用的。

If you're not great at taking notes  while you're talking to someone, bring a friend, bring a cofounder, ask the person if  you could record it.

如果你在和别人说话时不擅长记笔记，带上一位朋友，带上一位共同创始人，问问那个人你是否能把它录下来。

When in doubt, capture as much information as possible.

当有疑问时，尽可能多地捕获信息。

Keep it  casual.

随意一点。

Like I said before, you could just show up.

就像我之前说的，你可以直接出现。

You don't have to preplan  this.

你不必预先计划好这件事。

You don't have to have 20 minute blocks on your calendar scheduled for days  on end of user interviews.

你不需要在日程表上安排20分钟的时间来结束用户访谈。

Feel free to react.

请随意反应。

Honestly, you'll learn so much through  the first five or ten user interviews that your process will dramatically improve from those  first interviews to the next batch.

老实说，通过前五到十次用户面试，你会学到很多东西，从第一次面试到下一批面试，你的过程将会有极大的改进。

So don't feel like you have to do a  hundred user interviews all at the same time.

所以不要觉得你必须同时做一百个用户访谈。

Just start with one, start with three,  start with five until you get the hang of it.

从一个开始，从三个开始，从五个开始直到你掌握了窍门。

The third thing is you  need to be cognizant of the other person's time.

第三件事是你需要了解对方的时间。

Again, going back to what I  said at the beginning, we love our idea, we're founders, we love talking about our  ideas.

再次回到我在开始时所说的，我们喜欢我们的想法，我们是创始人，我们喜欢谈论我们的想法。

So you need to keep yourself in check and make sure that you're cognizant  of the other person's time.

所以你需要控制自己，确保你知道别人的时间。

Honestly, you'll be able to get probably the best information  out of, say, a 10 to 15 minute long first interview, and that might be  all the time you need just for that initial chat.

老实说，你可能会从10到15分钟的第一次面试中得到最好的信息，而这可能就是你第一次聊天所需要的全部时间了。

As you move past the  idea stage into testing your prototype with users, the next major kind of benefit that  you can get from talking to users is figuring out who will be your best  first customer.

当您通过想法阶段进入与用户测试原型时，您可以从与用户交谈中获得的下一种主要好处是找出谁将是您最好的第一个客户。

This is critical because it's possible that if you choose the wrong first  customer, that you may be led down a path that constrains you or artificially traps  you without actually getting paid by that first customer.

这一点很关键，因为如果你选择了错误的第一个客户，你可能会被引导到一条限制你或人为地陷害你的道路上，而没有真正得到第一个客户的付款。

So, we've created a framework that  you can use to begin to identify, before you begin working with them, who the  best first customers will be.

因此，我们已经创建了一个框架，在您开始与他们合作之前，您可以使用它来确定谁是最好的第一客户。

During user interviews, at this stage, I love to ask  questions that extract numerical answers to three facts about the customer that I'm working with.

在用户访谈过程中，在这个阶段，我喜欢问一些问题，提取关于我正在工作的客户的三个事实的数字答案。

 The first one that I want to get to the bottom of is, how much  does this problem cost them today? And I like to get a hard number, either  in terms of how much revenue do they stand to earn if they solve this  problem or how much expense do they currently spend trying to solve this problem? How  much money is wasted today as they try to solve this problem.

我想弄清楚的第一个问题是，这个问题今天花了他们多少钱？我喜欢得到一个硬性的数字，无论是关于如果他们解决了这个问题，他们将获得多少收入，或者他们目前为解决这个问题而花费了多少费用？今天他们试图解决这个问题时浪费了多少钱。

Second one that  I like to get to the bottom of is, how frequently do they encounter this  problem? Do they encounter it on an hourly basis, a daily basis, quarterly basis, yearly  basis? The best problems that startups can target are ones that are encountered more frequently.

第二个问题，我想弄清楚的是，他们遇到这个问题的频率有多高？他们是否每小时、每天、每季度、每年都会遇到这种情况？初创公司可以瞄准的最好的问题是更频繁地遇到的问题。

 This is usually beneficial for two reasons.

这通常是有益的，原因有两个。

One is, they encounter a problem on a  more regular basis.

一个是，他们经常遇到问题。

It means that the customer's feeling the pain of that problem on  a more regular basis, and they'll be much more receptive to a potential solution.

这意味着客户更经常地感受到该问题的痛苦，并且他们将更容易接受潜在的解决方案。

The  second reason why you want to tackle a problem that people encounter on a more  frequent basis is, you'll get more chances to know whether your product is actually solving  a problem.

你想要解决人们经常遇到的问题的第二个原因是，你会有更多的机会知道你的产品是否真的在解决问题。

In my case with Pebble, I love the fact that I was working  on a device that was kind of intended to be used every day.

在我使用Pebble的情况下，我喜欢这样一个事实，那就是我正在设计一种每天都要使用的设备。

You know,  you wake up in the morning, you put your watch on.

你知道，你早上醒来，戴上手表。

That was great for  me because I knew that if they weren't, if users weren't wearing their watch on  a regular basis, that meant that I was doing something wrong.

这对我来说很棒，因为我知道如果他们不戴手表，如果用户没有定期佩戴手表，那就意味着我做错了什么。

So the best first  customers are ones that have this problem very frequently.

因此，最好的第一客户是那些经常遇到这个问题的客户。

The third thing that you want  to get to the bottom of is, how large is their budget for solving this  problem? You can imagine that, say you're solving something for an industrial assembly line, a  problem on the industrial assembly line.

第三件事，你想弄清楚的是，他们解决这个问题的预算有多大？你可以想象，比如说你在为一条工业装配线解决一些事情，工业装配线上的一个问题。

If you're talking to the operator, the person who's  actually there on the assembly line, they may encounter this problem on a really regular  basis, but they just don't have the budget.

如果你正在和操作员交谈，实际上是在装配线上的人，他们可能会经常遇到这个问题，但他们就是没有预算。

They don't have the authority to actually  solve the problem.

他们没有实际解决问题的权力。

That's their boss or that's someone above them in the office or  in the headquarters.

那是他们的老板，或者是他们在办公室或总部的上级。

So, again, as you're trying to identify the best first customers, make  sure that you're trying to, make sure that you're asking questions about whether they actually  have the ability to solve the problem, given the choice.

所以，再一次，当你试图确定最好的第一客户时，确保你正在努力，确保你问的是他们是否真的有能力解决问题，如果有选择的话。

I like to visualize answers  to these three sets of customer questions as overlapping Venn diagrams, with best first customer  being at the center of the Venn diagram where they have the highest numerical answers  to the three questions that I outlined.

我喜欢将这三组客户问题的答案视作重叠的维恩图，其中最好的第一个客户位于维恩图的中心，他们对我概述的三个问题有最高的数字答案。

Let's take a quick example.

让我们来举个简单的例子。

Imagine if you're  working on like a super smart blender that's designed to produce the tastiest new fruit  smoothies.

想象一下，如果你像一个超级智能搅拌机一样工作，这是为了生产最美味的新水果冰沙而设计的。

You talk to several users.

您与几个用户交谈。

Let's say you're talking to McDonald's, The French Laundry  and the Google cafe.

假设你正在和麦当劳，法国洗衣店和谷歌咖啡馆聊天。

You create a spreadsheet that simply has three columns with the  answers to the questions that you've extracted through your user interviews.

您创建了一个电子表格，其中只有三列，其中包含您通过用户访谈提取的问题的答案。

This data can actually  be used in prioritizing which customer you begin to sell your product to first.

这些数据实际上可以用来确定您首先开始向哪个客户销售产品的优先顺序。

For  example, the French laundry is an amazing restaurant up in Napa.

例如，法国洗衣店是纳帕的一家令人惊叹的餐厅。

Maybe they have an  opportunity to roll out a new, extremely fancy over-the-top smoothie with your new technology.

也许他们有机会用你的新技术推出一种新的，极其花哨的超顶奶昔。

They  can extract a lot of money from each sale, but the frequency is not that  high.

他们可以从每次销售中榨取大量资金，但频率并不高。

There's just not that many customers that are interested in a fruit smoothie at  The French Laundry, and you're talking to maybe the sous-chef at the restaurant, so you  realize that they don't really have that much money to solve this problem even if  they wanted to.

没有多少顾客对法国洗衣店的水果冰沙感兴趣，而你正在和餐厅的副总厨交谈，所以你意识到即使他们想解决这个问题，他们也没有那么多的钱来解决这个问题。

The other potential customer that you're talking to is the chef at  one of the Google cafes.

你正在与之交谈的另一个潜在客户是谷歌咖啡馆的厨师。

Unfortunately for you, Google gives away their food for free  to their employees so that person doesn't actually stand to earn more money or save  that much more money if they were to use your new smoothie technology in their  restaurant.

对你来说不幸的是，谷歌免费提供食物给他们的员工，所以如果他们在他们的餐厅使用你的新冰沙技术，那个人实际上不会赚更多的钱或省下那么多钱。

Granted, there are a lot of Googlers, so there probably would be a lot  of smoothies made per week, but at the same time, again, they just don't have  the budget to be able to really dig into this problem.

诚然，谷歌员工很多，所以每周可能会做很多冰沙，但同时，同样，他们只是没有预算来真正地深入研究这个问题。

So, you learn through  the initial customer interviews that McDonald's is actually the best potential first customer for your  product.

因此，通过最初的客户访谈，您了解到麦当劳实际上是您产品的最佳潜在第一客户。

While even though the cost of a new smoothie at McDonald's may not bring  in a large dollar amount per transaction, they have a ton of stores and each  of those stores services a ton of people.

尽管麦当劳的新奶昔的价格可能不会为每笔交易带来大量的美元收入，但他们有大量的商店，而且每一家商店都为大量的人提供服务。

On top of that, you happen to  get a warm introduction to the chief food officer of McDonald's, which I'm not even  sure they have, but that person actually controls a multibillion dollar budget.

最重要的是，你碰巧得到了麦当劳首席食品官的热情介绍，我甚至不确定他们有没有，但那个人实际上控制着数十亿美元的预算。

And if they  wanted to solve this problem, they would have the authority and they would have the  the budget to do so.

如果他们想解决这个问题，他们将有权力，他们将有预算来这样做。

So you put that information in your spreadsheet, and you  actually do a simple stack rank that just pulls the best answers to those questions  up to the top.

所以你把这些信息放在你的电子表格中，你实际上做了一个简单的堆栈排名，它只是将这些问题的最佳答案拉到顶部。

You can use this framework for pulling together all of the  information that you get from various user surveys to find the best customers.

您可以使用此框架将从各种用户调查中获得的所有信息汇集在一起，以找到最佳客户。

The last  stage before product market fit that can benefit from user interviews is actually the process  of iterating towards product market fit.

在产品市场匹配之前，可以从用户访谈中获益的最后一个阶段实际上是向产品市场匹配迭代的过程。

Paul Graham's cut definition for product market fit is  when you've made something that people want.

保罗·格雷厄姆(Paul Graham)对产品市场适合度的切分定义是，当你做出了人们想要的东西。

Mark Andreessen and also has an amazing blog  post about a product market fit, where he describes it as when the product is  just being pulled out of you.

Mark Andreessen，还有一篇关于产品市场契合的令人惊叹的博客文章，他将其描述为当产品刚刚从你身上被拉出来的时候。

When you no longer have to push the product  on customers.

当你不再需要把产品推给顾客的时候。

They're just pulling it, pulling it from you.

他们只是把它从你身上拉出来。

But the problem with these  definitions of product market fit is that they're vague.

但这些产品市场契合度的定义存在的问题是它们含糊不清。

They're also retroactive in that you  have to already have product market fit in order to know that you've reached it.

它们也具有追溯性，因为你必须已经有产品市场适合，以便知道你已经达到了它。

 So they're not as useful for helping you figure out which features you need to  build in order to iterate, in order to improve your product to get to product  market fit.

因此，它们对于帮助您确定需要构建哪些功能以进行迭代，以便改进您的产品以达到产品市场的适合程度，并不是很有用。

You may have heard of the app Superhuman, which is a super fast  email client.

你可能听说过超人应用程序，这是一个超快的电子邮件客户端。

Well, the CEO published an amazing blog post a little while ago about  how he built a, well, how he was actually annoyed with this vague definition of  what product market fit is and how it was a lagging indicator that didn't help  him predict product market fit.

嗯，首席执行官不久前发表了一篇令人惊叹的博文，讲述了他是如何建立一个，嗯，他实际上是如何对产品市场适合度的模糊定义感到恼火的，以及它是一个滞后的指标，并没有帮助他预测产品市场适合度。

It only told him whether he'd achieved it or not.

它只告诉他是否做到了。

 He wanted to create a real time quantitative system that'd help guide his company towards  product market fit, and of course it involved talking to users.

他想创建一个实时定量系统，帮助指导他的公司走向产品市场，当然，这涉及到与用户交谈。

He wrote a great  blog post on this.

他为此写了一篇很棒的博文。

You could just Google it.

你可以谷歌一下。

Just going to touch on it,  but I would highly recommend reading the entire thing because it is fantastic.

我只是想触及一下，但我强烈建议阅读整篇文章，因为它太棒了。

In it  he describes a process where on a weekly basis he asks pretty much all his  customers, but it doesn't even have to be your entire customer base, it could just  be 30, 40 users, a critical question.

他在书中描述了一个过程，在这个过程中，他每周询问几乎所有的客户，但它甚至不一定是你的整个客户群，它可能只是30，40个用户，这是一个关键的问题。

How would you feel if you could no  longer use Superhuman? Three answers? Very disappointed, somewhat disappointed, not disappointed.

如果你不能再使用超人，你会有什么感觉？三个答案？非常失望，有点失望，不是失望。

He measured the percentage  of users who answered the question, very disappointed.

他测量了回答问题的用户的百分比，非常失望。

These are the users who most value  your product.

这些是最看重你的产品的用户。

These are the users who your product has now become a key part  of their life.

这些是你的产品现在已经成为他们生活的关键部分的用户。

It's kind of weaseled their way into their daily habits.

这是一种黄鼠狼的方式进入他们的日常习惯。

He read  some analysis that said that If 40% or more of your user base reports that  they would be very disappointed if your product went away on a weekly basis, that  that's kind of the signal.

他读到一些分析说，如果你的用户群中有40%或更多的人报告说，如果你的产品每周都离开，他们会非常失望，这就是一种信号。

That's the the differentiation point that it says, if you  get past this point your product will just grow exponentially.

这就是它所说的差异点，如果你越过这个点，你的产品就会呈指数级增长。

He evaluated a number of  other successful companies and realized that the answer to this question was always around or  above 40%.

他对其他一些成功的公司进行了评估，并意识到这个问题的答案总是在40%左右或40%以上。

So, again, I probably won't be able to go into it too much  more in detail, but I would recommend reading this blog post.

所以，再一次，我可能不能更详细地进入它，但我会推荐阅读这篇博客文章。

If you're at the  stage where you're iterating and you actively have users that you can ask this question  of, this can be an immensely useful thing for quantitatively determining whether the features that  you worked on in the previous week were actually benefiting or adding to your product  market fit or potentially detracting from it as well.

如果你处于迭代的阶段，并且你有活跃的用户可以问这个问题，这对于定量地确定你在前一周工作的功能是否真的受益或增加你的产品市场适合性，或者潜在地减损它，可能是一个非常有用的事情。

Some other great tips that we've  found at this stage is kind of a simple hack.

我们在这个阶段发现的其他一些很好的技巧是一种简单的黑客攻击。

Ask your users for the  phone number during signup because oftentimes you'll be looking at the data and you'll be  wondering, why is the data showing this particular kind of learning about our customers? You  may be thinking in aggregate, 20% of people have this problem.

在注册过程中向您的用户询问电话号码，因为您经常会看到数据，您会想知道，为什么这些数据显示了关于我们客户的这种特殊类型的学习？你可能在总体上想，20%的人都有这个问题。

Sometimes it helps to  just get on the phone and talk to one person who is encountering this problem.

有时，只需通过电话与遇到此问题的一个人交谈就会有所帮助。

 So I always encourage founders to put contact information, including phone number, which is a  direct connection to customers, pretty high up in the user signup flow.

因此，我总是鼓励创始人在用户注册流程中将联系信息(包括电话号码)放在相当高的位置，这是与客户的直接联系。

Second one is  don't design by committee.

二是不要由委员会设计。

You can't simply ask your users what features they want.

你不能简单地问你的用户他们想要什么功能。

You  have to begin to understand whether those features are truly going to help make your  product more sticky and more useful.

你必须开始了解这些功能是否真的会帮助你的产品更粘性和更有用。

You can do this through the advice that the  Superhuman CEO lays out in his blog post.

你可以通过超人CEO在他的博客文章中提出的建议来做到这一点。

Or you could ask other tactical questions.

或者你可以问其他战术问题。

 Instead of asking, will users be interested in using this new product or this new  feature, instead say, "Here's an upgrade flow.

用户是否有兴趣使用这个新产品或新功能，而不是问，而是说，“这是一个升级流程。

If you want this new product, put your  credit card, or if you want this new feature, put your credit card information or  pay more." Even before you actually built out the feature, this could help give you  information about whether the feature that you're working on is actually something that the users  are gonna use.

如果你想要这个新产品，放入你的信用卡，或者如果你想要这个新功能，放入你的信用卡信息或支付更多。“甚至在你真正构建这个功能之前，这可以帮助你提供关于你正在使用的功能是否真的是用户将要使用的功能的信息。

The third thing to do during user interviews at this stage is  to remember to discard bad data.

在这个阶段的用户访谈中要做的第三件事是记住丢弃不好的数据。

Some of the kind of worst bad data that  you may encounter is compliments.

你可能会遇到的一些最糟糕的数据是赞美。

People may say, "Oh, I love the new design," or  "Man, this thing is really useful." You may love that during the course of your  user interviews, but they actually are not useful information because it's not specific.

人们可能会说，“哦，我喜欢这个新设计，”或者“伙计，这东西真的很有用。”你可能喜欢在你的用户访谈过程中这样做，但它们实际上并不是有用的信息，因为它并不具体。

It's more  of a general statement about your product and it's not tactical.

它更多的是关于你的产品的一般性声明，而不是战术。

It's not giving you  correct information on what you can change or what you can improve about your your  product.

它并没有给你正确的信息，关于你可以改变什么或者你可以改进你的产品。

The second main type of bad data that you may encounter is fluff.

您可能遇到的第二种主要错误数据类型是毛发。

These  our hypotheticals.

这些是我们的假设。

These are generic statements.

这些是通用语句。

Whenever you're in the middle of a user interview  and you start getting onto this hypothetical, oh, here's what the product may look like  in the future, try to steer it back to specifics.

每当你在进行用户访谈时，你开始讨论这个假设，哦，这就是未来产品可能的样子，试着把它引回到细节上来。

Again, you're conducting a user  interview, not to pitch your product, but to learn about problems or issues that the  user has faced in their past so that you can improve it in the future.

同样，您正在进行用户访谈，不是为了推销您的产品，而是为了了解用户在过去遇到的问题或问题，以便您可以在将来改进它。

 That's it.

就这样。

That was meant to be a quick, short dive into talking to users.

这本应是一个快速、短暂的与用户交谈的过程。

 I don't know if we have any time for questions.
Speaker 2:We have some time.
Eric Migicovsky:Cool.
Speaker 2:[inaudible 00:31:06].
Eric Migicovsky:Awesome.

我不知道我们是否有时间提问。演讲者2：我们还有一些时间。埃里克·米吉科夫斯基：酷。扬声器2：[听不见00：31：06]。埃里克·米吉科夫斯基：太棒了。

Well, I'd love to answer any questions, but other than that, thank you.

嗯，我很乐意回答任何问题，但除此之外，谢谢你。

Thank  you very much.


非常感谢。
