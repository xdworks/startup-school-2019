# Kevin Hale - How to Evaluate Startup Ideas pt.1

Kevin Hale:Okay, so this is how to evaluate startup ideas, and this is actually a new  set of content that we've developed based on a lot of feedback that we saw  from the last startup school, and what we noticed is a lot of people's challenges.

凯文·黑尔：好的，这就是如何评估创业想法，这实际上是我们基于上一所创业学校看到的大量反馈而开发的一组新内容，我们注意到的是很多人的挑战。

So last year's curriculum actually had a lot of content that ended up being, when  we looked at the data for who's participating in startup school, was like, "Oh, this  is much more advanced, it's much further along." A lot of people, for instance, like,  "I had no idea." Or like, "I have too many ideas." That they don't know  which one to pursue.

所以去年的课程实际上有很多内容，最后，当我们查看谁参与创业学校的数据时，就像是，“哦，这更先进，它更先进。”很多人，例如，就像，“我不知道。”或者说，“我有太多的想法。”他们不知道该追求哪一个。

Because a main reason why a lot of people are only  able to work on their startup sometimes part-time, yes, they might be stuck without resources,  but they didn't have conviction.

因为很多人有时只能做兼职工作的一个主要原因是，他们可能被困在没有资源的情况下，但他们没有信念。

They didn't know like, "Oh, what would I have to  believe in order to say, 'I want to quit my job'?" This is also a  really great sort of skill to sort of have, because if you are realizing you  need to pivot, how do you evaluate if you need to do that? And then  also if you're pivoting to something else, how do you evaluate whether something is worth  going to? And if you already have a launch company, then you might have problems  with like, "Why isn't this growing?" Or, "How do I improve it?" And evaluating your  start up, especially in the way that sort of investors evaluate startups ideas, we find  it's going to be really, really useful.

他们不知道，“哦，我要相信什么才能说，‘我想辞掉我的工作’？”这也是一种非常棒的技能，因为如果你意识到你需要转向，你如何评估你是否需要这样做？然后，如果你正在转向其他的事情，你如何评估某件事情是否值得去做呢？如果你已经有了一家发射公司，那么你可能会遇到类似这样的问题：“为什么这个没有增长？”或者，“我如何改进它？”评估你的初创公司，特别是在投资者评估初创公司想法的方式上，我们发现这将非常有用。

This is like myth about Y Combinator is  that people think YC only funds companies who have tons and tons of traction.

这就像是关于Y Combinator的神话，人们认为YC只为那些拥有大量牵引力的公司提供资金。

That  nowadays the only way to get into YC is you have to have lots of  revenue, or tons of users already.

现在进入YC的唯一方法是你必须有大量的收入，或者已经有大量的用户。

And part of that has to do with the  press and then the exposure of the companies that make it to demo day; those  are the stories you tend to hear.

其中一部分与媒体有关，然后是公司在演示日的曝光；这些都是你倾向于听到的故事。

But that being said, there's lots of great  examples of companies who actually got accepted just with an idea.

但话虽如此，有很多很好的例子，公司实际上只是因为一个想法而被接受。

And so, Zenefits is  a really good classic one, Parker was a single, non-technical founder who pitched an idea  to YC and he got in that way; we also had Reddit.

因此，Zenefits是一个非常好的经典，Parker是一个单独的，非技术的创始人，他向YC推荐了一个想法，他就这样得到了；我们还有Reddit。

So, technically, they  were forced to pivot right away, so they hadn't written a single line of code.

所以，从技术上讲，他们被迫马上转向，所以他们没有编写任何代码。

And then my experience in YC is actually exactly the same.

然后我在YC的经历实际上是完全相同的。

So when I founded  Wufoo, and we entered that second batch, we also had not written a single line  of code; PG had invested us at just the idea stage.

所以当我创建Wu foo时，我们进入了第二批，我们也没有写一行代码；PG只是在我们的想法阶段投资了我们。

And so I feel  fully committed now, as a partner, to always be trying to find and dedicate time  and energy to funding companies who are just at the idea stage.

因此，作为合作伙伴，我现在感到完全致力于始终努力寻找并将时间和精力投入到刚刚处于构思阶段的公司。

A lot of  our efforts here for working on startup school, is to help you work on how  to talk and think about your startup.

我们在这里为创业学校所做的很多努力，是为了帮助你学习如何谈论和思考你的创业公司。

And that if we can fix that, it  can help you sort of inspire us to be like, "Oh yeah, I can believe  in what you're doing." And a lot of times, founders get in the way when  they're telling their narrative.

如果我们能解决这个问题，它可以帮助你激励我们，“哦，是的，我可以相信你正在做的事情。”很多时候，创始人在讲述他们的故事时会遇到阻碍。

So how can I predict if an investor will like my  idea? That's, ultimately, what I'm trying to figure out.

那么，我如何预测投资者是否会喜欢我的想法呢？最终，这就是我想弄明白的。

And the answer is really easy.

答案真的很简单。

And so for us at YC, the definition of a startup is a company that  is designed or created to try to grow very quickly.

因此，对于YC的我们来说，初创公司的定义是一家旨在快速发展的公司。

So if you're not trying  to build a company that grows very, very fast, then you're just building a normal  company; it's a small business.

所以，如果你不是在试图建立一家增长非常快的公司，那么你只是在建立一家正常的公司；这是一项小生意。

And there's nothing wrong with that, but these companies are  the ones that investors are interested in.

这并没有什么错，但这些公司才是投资者感兴趣的公司。

So if you're hoping to build something that  will have tons of users, that will have huge valuations, that'll be able to attract  venture funding, then the evidence that we want is evidence that shows that your company  can grow quickly.

所以，如果你希望建立一个拥有大量用户的东西，它将有巨大的估值，这将能够吸引风险投资，那么我们需要的证据是证明你的公司可以快速发展的证据。

I have a confession to make, if you ever meet me, or  talk to me about your startup, and kind of recruiting, or at one of these  events, I will never tell you that I do not like your idea.

我有一件事要坦白，如果你见过我，或者跟我谈过你的创业公司，或者是招聘，或者在这些活动中，我永远不会告诉你我不喜欢你的想法。

And there's  a reason for that, it's not to be nice to you, it's not to blow  smoke up your ass.

这是有原因的，它不是为了对你好，它不是为了把烟吹到你的屁股上。

I learned this way of thinking from Paul Graham, he says  like, look, "The average investor, or a lot of the investors that you see, when  you talk to them about your idea, it feels like they're trying to poke holes  in your idea.

我从保罗·格雷厄姆那里学到了这种思维方式，他说，看，“一般投资者，或者你看到的很多投资者，当你和他们谈论你的想法时，感觉他们就像是试图在你的想法中挖洞。

They're trying to figure out what's wrong with it, and then they're  trying to show, sometimes, just how smart they are." And he explained that his job,  and the way he sees our work at YC, is that it's not to figure  out what's wrong with company, but to figure out how it could possibly win.

他们试图找出问题所在，然后他们试图展示，有时，他们是多么聪明。“他解释说，他的工作，以及他看待我们在YC的工作的方式，是不是找出公司的问题所在，而是弄清楚公司如何可能获胜。

Because  our bets, the ones that win, are the ones that are non-obvious.

因为我们的赌注，获胜的赌注，是那些不明显的赌注。

And so for  us to figure out the non-obvious stuff, it's going to not sound obvious when they  first tell you.

所以对于我们来说，要弄清楚那些不明显的东西，当他们第一次告诉你的时候，听起来不会很明显。

And so we have to work on our imagination, we have to  work on our optimism to figure out, "Oh what is the way that whatever story  that they're telling me could become a billion dollar company?" And then a great investor  pitches that back to the founder.

所以我们必须发挥我们的想象力，我们必须培养我们的乐观主义，去弄清楚，“哦，他们告诉我的任何故事都可以成为一家十亿美元的公司的方式是什么？”然后一位伟大的投资者将这一点回馈给创始人。

I figure out all the ways that I think  whatever you're doing could possibly become big, and then I'm trying to convince you that  this is what needs to happen so that I would have the evidence, or that  you will be on the right path to having a company that grows quickly.

我想出了所有我认为无论你在做什么都可能变得很大的方法，然后我试图说服你，这就是需要发生的事情，这样我才能有证据，或者你将走上一条正确的道路，拥有一家快速发展的公司。

A  startup idea is, basically, a hypothesis and this is the way you should think about  it.

初创公司的想法基本上是一种假设，这就是你应该考虑它的方式。

It's a hypothesis about why a company could grow quickly.

这是一个关于为什么一家公司可以快速发展的假设。

And your job is  to figure out how to construct your hypothesis, basically the pitch, to the investor so  they understand how it can go grow quickly.

你的工作是找出如何构建你的假设，基本上就是向投资者推销，这样他们就能理解如何快速增长。

A lot of times, people make the  mistakes of trying to just accurately describe or over describe a lot of different parts.

很多时候，人们会犯错误，试图仅仅准确地描述或过度描述许多不同的部分。

So I'm going to break this down.

所以我要把它分解。

So just like a normal hypothesis has a  pretty decent structure for this, this will, hopefully, help you sort of workshop like understanding,  "Oh this is exactly all the reasons why this should succeed." And so even before  we start even building anything, we can have an understanding of like, "Oh, here's the  potential path of this company." Or, "Here's the things I need to prove that show  that this comedy could do well." So the first is the problem, so the startup  idea's composed of three parts, the first part is a problem; and it's basically the  initial conditions.

所以就像一个正常的假设有一个相当不错的结构，这将，希望，能帮助你像理解，“哦，这就是为什么这应该成功的所有原因。因此，即使在我们开始建造任何东西之前，我们也可以理解，“哦，这是这家公司的潜在路径。”或者，“这是我需要证明的事情，证明这部喜剧可以做得很好。”所以第一个是问题，所以启动的想法由三个部分组成，第一个部分是一个问题；它基本上是初始条件。

You have to explain to me, "What is the setting for this company  that allows it to be able to grow quickly?" The second is the solution.

你必须向我解释，“这个公司的背景是什么，使它能够快速成长？”第二个是解决方案。

So  this is, basically, what is the experiment that you're basically running, within those conditions, for  it to grow really quickly? And the third is what's your insight? So what's your  explanation why the thing that you're going to try, your experiment, is going to end  up being successful? Those are the three components that I'm always trying to figure out  when I'm listening to someone's pitch.

这就是，基本上，你正在进行的实验是什么，在这些条件下，让它快速增长？第三个问题是你的洞察力是什么？那么你怎么解释为什么你要尝试的东西，你的实验，最终会成功呢？这就是当我在听别人的推介时，我总是试图弄清楚的三个组成部分。

Here's a tip for talking about the problem, or  to know whether your problem, your initial conditions, are correct.

这里有一个关于谈论问题的提示，或者知道你的问题，你的初始条件是否正确。

The first is good problems,  they're popular; so a lot of people have the problem.

第一个是好问题，他们很受欢迎；所以很多人都有这个问题。

You want to avoid problems  that there's a small number of people that have it.

你想避免有少数人患有这种病的问题。

We like problems that are  growing so, therefore, the market basically, is it growing at a rate that more and  more people are going to be having the problem? And it's growing faster than other  people's, or other types of problems? We like problems that are urgent, ones that need  to be solved very, very quickly.

我们喜欢不断增长的问题，因此，市场基本上是以越来越多的人将会有问题的速度增长的吗？而且它比其他人或其他类型的问题增长得更快？我们喜欢紧急的问题，那些需要很快解决的问题。

We like problems that are really expensive to solve,  because if you're able to sort of solve it, then you can charge a lot  of money, potentially.

我们喜欢解决真正昂贵的问题，因为如果你能够解决它，那么你就可以收取很多钱，潜在的。

We like problems that are mandatory so, therefore, it's like, "Ah, people  have this problem, and they have to solve it." And then we like problems that  are frequent, ones that people are going to encounter over, and over, and over again;  and often in a frequent time interval.

我们喜欢强制性的问题，因此，它就像是，“啊，人们有这个问题，他们必须解决它。”然后我们喜欢频繁出现的问题，那些人们会一次又一次地遇到的问题；而且经常是在频繁的时间间隔中。

So what you want to have is some  aspect of the problem that you're working on, at least one of them, and it's  ideal if you have multiple of them.

所以你想要的是你正在处理的问题的某些方面，至少其中的一个，如果你有多个这样的问题是最理想的。

You don't have to have all of them,  but it's one of those things where it's like if your company isn't growing, or  if someone's not as excited about the problem, it's probably missing some of these characteristics.

你不需要拥有所有这些，但如果你的公司没有成长，或者如果有人对这个问题不那么兴奋，那么它很可能缺少了其中的一些特征。

The last one about frequency is super important because I like problems, and you'll find  a lot of YC partners like problems, a lot, that gives people a lot of  opportunities to convert.

最后一个关于频率的问题非常重要，因为我喜欢问题，你会发现很多YC合作伙伴，比如问题，很多，这给了人们很多转换的机会。

Part of that has to do with some theory, so B.J. Fogg, he's a researcher at Stanford, and he tosses this formula up all the time.

其中一部分与一些理论有关，所以B.J.福格，他是斯坦福大学的研究员，他一直在抛出这个公式。

And he says basically, "If you're trying to change someone's behavior, you have three things  you need to have in place.

他说，基本上，“如果你试图改变某人的行为，你需要做好三件事。

You need to have the motivation, the ability, and  the trigger; they need to all happen at the same time." So the motivation is  like, "I have this problem, I need to solve whatever it is." The ability is  your startup, and the last is the trigger.

你需要有动力，能力和触发器；它们都需要同时发生。所以动机就像是，“我有这个问题，我需要解决任何问题。”能力是你的初创公司，最后一个是触发器。

What's going to be the thing that  gets them to all of a sudden realize, "Oh, I need to solve it with  your thing?" And so a lot of companies will have like, "Oh I built something  but, for some reason, no one's signing up." Or like, "They're not using it, they're  not engaged, I have no retention." And a lot of the times is because it's  you're hoping that they will somehow just remember, on their own, that they have the  problem, and to start using you.

什么东西会让他们突然意识到，“哦，我需要用你的东西解决它？”所以很多公司会说，“哦，我做了一些东西，但是，由于某种原因，没有人签约。”或者说，“他们没有使用它，他们没有订婚，我没有保留。”很多时候是因为你希望他们能以某种方式记住，他们自己有问题，并开始利用你。

And, oftentimes, most companies don't send enough, for example,  email notifications, or triggers, or reminders, or figure out ways to come back into the  app, or figure out ways to be back in front of the user at the  right time.

而且，通常情况下，大多数公司都没有发送足够的电子邮件通知，或者触发器，或者提醒，或者想办法回到应用程序中，或者想办法在正确的时间回到用户的面前。

And if you can't figure out those opportunities, it's really hard to get  people to switch over to using your solution, service, or product.

如果你不能找出这些机会，就很难让人们转而使用你的解决方案、服务或产品。

So our ideal problems  are millions of users, millions of people have it.

所以我们的理想问题是数百万的用户，数百万的人都有它。

That's why people like to work  on consumer companies, that's why some investors like to focus on them.

这就是为什么人们喜欢在消费品公司工作，这就是为什么一些投资者喜欢关注他们。

We like markets  that are growing 20% a year; the problem is growing quickly.

我们喜欢每年增长20%的市场；问题正在迅速发展。

We like problems where  people were trying to solve it right now, immediately.

我们喜欢人们试图立刻解决的问题。

We like problems that just cost  a ton of money; so billions of dollars.

我们喜欢花费大量金钱的问题；因此，数十亿美元。

Or at least they all add up  to some billion dollar total addressable market.

或者至少它们加起来总共有几十亿美元的可寻址市场。

We like problems where the law has changed,  and regulation is put up there, and now people have to solve a bunch of  problems.

我们喜欢法律改变的问题，法规在那里建立起来，现在人们不得不解决一大堆问题。

You saw a ton of healthcare startups were born after Affordable Care Act was  passed.

你可以看到，在“平价医疗法案”通过后，大量的医疗初创公司诞生了。

And a lot of that had to do with there was now, all of  a sudden, opportunity; this problem that all these hospitals and clinics had to solve.

很大程度上是因为现在突然间有了机会，所有这些医院和诊所都必须解决这个问题。

And  then we like problems that people need to solve multiple times a day, or will  use it multiple times a day.

然后我们喜欢人们需要一天解决多次的问题，或者一天使用多次的问题。

[inaudible 00:10:35]'s a good classic example, but people also  really love Slack, because it's like, "Oh, I'm going to be engaged in using it  multiple times a day during the workday." Solution.

[听不见的00：10：35]是一个很好的经典例子，但人们也真的很喜欢Slack，因为它就像，“哦，我要在工作日中每天使用它多次。”解决方案。

So there's pretty much only one piece  of advice I really have for the solution that's the best advice that you could  ever follow, and that is don't start here.

所以，对于这个解决方案，我只有一个建议，那就是你可以遵循的最好的建议，那就是不要从这里开始。

So what I mean by that is,  at YC we have an acronym for a problem that we try to avoid or,  basically, an application that we have to go like, "Oh man, I wish they had  started with the problem first." And we call it 'SISP', and it means Solution In  Search of a Problem.

所以我的意思是，在YC，我们有一个首字母缩写来表示我们试图避免的问题，或者基本上，一个我们必须去的应用程序，“哦，天哪，我希望他们先从问题开始。”我们称之为“SISP”，意思是寻找问题的解决方案。

And often what happens is you're an engineer, you're excited about  technology, some new technology has come on the scene.

经常发生的是你是一名工程师，你对技术感到兴奋，一些新的技术出现了。

Let's say it's Blockchain, let's say  it's like React Native, or whatever the new thing is and you're like, "I want  to build something with this." It's a large reason why you start working on a  startup project.

让我们说它是区块链，让我们说它就像反应原生，或者不管新事物是什么，你就像，“我想用这个来建造一些东西。”这是你开始从事创业项目的一个很大的原因。

And then you go like, "Okay, what kind of problem can I solve  now? I want to use this no matter what." And then you try to shoehorn  a problem into the solution.

然后你会说，“好吧，我现在可以解决什么样的问题？我无论如何都想用这个。”然后你试图把一个问题硬塞进解决方案。

And what ends up happening is that's a much more  difficult way to grow the company.

而最终发生的是，这是一种更加困难的发展公司的方式。

It's not impossible for companies to grow this way,  it's super inefficient.

公司不是不可能以这种方式增长，这是超级低效的。

It's much better to be like, "Let me see what problems people  have, and I will use whatever is necessary to solve them." And, therefore, it's much  more likely that you will grow as a result.

最好是这样，“让我看看人们有什么问题，我会用一切必要的手段来解决它们。”因此，你更有可能因此成长。

Because the other way around, is  you might have to go and try to drum up the problem, or you have  to brand a problem as something that people have, and it's so much more difficult,  and you end up growing much more slowly as a result.

因为反过来，你可能不得不去尝试去鼓动这个问题，或者你不得不把一个问题贴上别人的标签，这是非常困难的，结果你的成长速度会慢得多。

So look at what  you're building right now, or look at the reason why you're trying to do this  startup, and is it because you only care about the technology and building something in  that? Or have you started with a problem, you go like, "I'm going to do  whatever it takes to solve people, user's, customer's issues." The last one's a little tricky.

所以，看看你现在正在构建什么，或者看看你为什么要尝试做这个创业公司，是因为你只关心技术和在其中构建一些东西吗？或者你是从一个问题开始的，你会说，“我会尽一切努力解决人，用户，客户的问题。”最后一个有点棘手。

It's what is the insight? What's the reason why this solution is going to work?  And this is where a lot of companies sort of get tripped up.

是什么洞察力？这个解决方案成功的原因是什么？这就是很多公司被绊倒的地方。

Because it's  really about like what is your company's unfair advantage? Why are you going to win  versus everyone else? Why are you going to be the fastest one to sort of  grow? Because that insight is what's needed for the investor to choose you over anyone  else, and it has to be related to growth.

因为它实际上是关于你的公司的不公平优势是什么？为什么你要赢其他人？为什么你会成为增长最快的人？因为这种洞察力是投资者选择你而不是其他人所需要的，而且它必须与增长有关。

You have to have an unfair  advantage that explains why you're going to grow quickly.

你必须有一个不公平的优势来解释为什么你会快速成长。

If it's not related to that,  then it's not going to be something that an investor is going to find valuable.

如果它与此无关，那么它就不会是投资者会发现有价值的东西。

And the last one is, you need one.

最后一个是，你需要一个。

You can't just be like, "I have  a problem, I'm solving it." And then have no explanation why.

你不能只是说，“我有一个问题，我正在解决它。”然后没有解释为什么。

Without that last sort  of explanation, I can't use my imagination, I can't evaluate just solely on how well  you've thought through this problem.

没有最后一种解释，我无法运用我的想象力，我不能仅仅根据你对这个问题的思考程度来评价。

And so let's go through the types of unfair advantages  that your company have.

因此，让我们来看看贵公司拥有的不公平优势的类型。

So there's five different types and companies do not have all  of them.

所以有五种不同的类型，公司并没有全部拥有。

Really great ones, not surprising, will have all of them and we'll go  through two examples.

真正伟大的，并不令人惊讶的，将拥有所有这些，我们将通过两个例子。

But you want at least one, and it's nice if you can  have two or three; but for most of you, it's probably just one.

但你至少想要一个，如果你能有两个或三个很好；但对你们大多数人来说，可能只有一个。

So the  first one, so how do you know if you have a founder unfair advantage? And  so, all of these will be connected to numbers actually, which will help this make  this really easy.

所以第一个，那么你怎么知道你是否有一个创始人不公平的优势？因此，所有这些都将与数字联系起来，这将有助于使这一切变得非常容易。

Is like are you one in 10 of all the people in  the world who can solve this problem; are you a super expert? And 99% of  the people we fund at YC, do not fall into that category.

就像你是世界上十分之一能解决这个问题的人，你是一个超级专家吗？我们在YC资助的99%的人都不属于这一类。

And so if  you think it's like, "Well, I'm a product manager at Google." There's a lot of  product managers at Google.

所以如果你认为这就像，“嗯，我是谷歌的产品经理。”谷歌有很多产品经理。

If you say you're an engineer at Microsoft, there's a lot  of engineers at Microsoft.

如果你说你是微软的工程师，微软有很多工程师。

It's like great, but it's not one that will make me  think, "Oh, you have a greater unfair advantage than someone else." If you've done a  PhD and, let's say, you've done it on some kind of crazy biotech research, and  you have a special patent to be able to cure some kind of disease; then  you have a founder advantage.

这很棒，但它不会让我觉得，“哦，你比别人有更大的不公平优势。”如果你读过博士，比方说，你在某种疯狂的生物技术研究上做过，而且你有一项特殊的专利能够治愈某种疾病；那么你就有创始人的优势了。

Your market.

你的市场。

Is it growing 20% a year? By default,  if you just build the solution in the space, you should just automatically grow, because  you're just following a trend.

它的年增长率是20%吗？默认情况下，如果您只是在空间中构建解决方案，您应该只是自动增长，因为您只是跟随趋势。

If this is your only company advantage, then it's one  of the weakest ones that you could have.

如果这是你唯一的公司优势，那么它是你可能拥有的最弱的优势之一。

It is great to be in that  space, but you want to have something in addition to this.

在那个空间里是很棒的，但你想要的是除了这个之外的东西。

You're going to do  better than average because you've picked the right problem space, and the right set of  customers that want your problem.

您将比平均水平做得更好，因为您选择了正确的问题空间，以及需要您的问题的正确客户集。

But again, if you're in a market that is stagnating  or shrinking, then you're going to have investors worried about the longterm viability of your  company as a result.

但再说一次，如果你所处的市场停滞或萎缩，那么投资者会担心你公司的长期生存能力。

Product.

产品。

So this is super simple.

所以这非常简单。

Is your product 10x better  than the competition? If it is, then you, potentially, have an unfair advantage; and it  has to be very, very clear.

您的产品是否比竞争对手好10倍？如果是，那么你，潜在地，有一个不公平的优势；它必须非常，非常清楚。

Someone should be able to look at your product  and go like, "Oh shit, this is so much better than everything else I've ever  seen.

应该有人能够看到你的产品，然后说，“哦，该死，这比我见过的所有其他东西都要好得多。”

It is 10x faster, it is 10x cheaper, etc." And if it's not an  order of magnitude, let's say, it's just like 2x or 3x, again, that's nice, but  it's not enough for an investor to go like, "Oh, this is a slam dunk."  In regards to that 10x product and showing that you are able to have that  ...

它的速度快了10倍，便宜了10倍，等等。“如果它不是一个数量级，让我们说，它就像是2倍或3倍，再一次，这很好，但对投资者来说，这是不够的，”哦，这是一个灌篮。“关于那个10倍的产品，并表明你能够拥有它…”，这是一个很好的例子。

Later in startup school, I'm going to do a lecture on pricing.

稍后在创业学校，我将做一个关于定价的讲座。

And we'll  talk things about cost and value, and that'll help you sort of better understand is  like, "Oh, how to better prove out that 10x multiple using sort of metrics and  numbers and pricing." Acquisition.

我们将讨论关于成本和价值的事情，这将帮助你更好地理解，就像，“哦，如何更好地使用指标和数字和定价来证明10倍的倍数。”收购。

So, a lot of people think that if you go to  investor and you've done a bunch of Facebook, or Twitter, or Google ads and you  show your CAC and LTV, that you will able to prove that you have a  sustainable sort of acquisition model.

所以，很多人认为，如果你去投资者那里，你做了一堆Facebook，Twitter，或谷歌的广告，你展示了你的CAC和LTV，你将能够证明你有一种可持续的收购模式。

And I want you to know that if paid acquisition  is the only way that you are able to grow your company, then I'm going  to discount that channel of growth greatly.

我想让你知道，如果付费收购是你能够发展公司的唯一途径，那么我会大大降低这个增长渠道。

That is because if you actually get really  popular, you've actually start being someone significant, let's say, becoming a $100 million revenue company,  then you're going to attract a lot of competitors in this space, and that advantage  is going to quickly dwindle over time.

这是因为如果你真的很受欢迎，你实际上已经开始成为一个重要的人物，比如说，成为一家收入1亿美元的公司，那么你就会在这个领域吸引很多竞争对手，而且随着时间的推移，这种优势将会迅速减弱。

Blue [inaudible] is a really good example of  this.

蓝色[听不见]就是一个很好的例子。

Almost all their acquisitions in paid, and then once they ate through that, there's  almost nowhere else for them to sort of go.

他们几乎所有的收购都是付费的，然后一旦他们吃完了，他们几乎没有其他地方可以去。

You want to find acquisition paths  that costs no money.

您希望找到无需花钱的获取途径。

And my favorite companies, the ones that become really great, are  the ones that can grow by word of mouth; this is a good percentage of  the way they grow.

我最喜欢的公司，那些变得非常伟大的公司，是那些可以通过口耳相传增长的公司；这是他们增长方式的一个很好的比例。

And so in the early days of a startup, if you  don't have any money, that's actually very great way of exercising, "How do I grow  this without having to pay for it?" And so in the beginning, we tell you  to do things that don't scale, but this is what you sort of want to  accomplish.

所以在初创公司的早期，如果你没有钱，这实际上是非常好的锻炼方式，“我怎样才能在不花钱的情况下发展它呢？”所以在开始的时候，我们告诉你做一些不能扩展的事情，但这就是你想要完成的事情。

It's like, "Do I have an advantage that is free?" And the last one  is, do you have a monopoly? And so we don't mean this in the monocle  Monopoly game sense, so we mean it as as your company grows, is it more  difficult for you to be defeated by competitors, do you get stronger? And so good  examples of that are like companies with network effects and marketplaces.

就像是，“我有免费的优势吗？”最后一个问题是，你有垄断吗？所以我们不是在Moncle Monopoly游戏意义上的这个意思，所以我们的意思是随着你的公司的发展，你被竞争对手打败是不是更难了，你变得更强了吗？这方面的很好的例子就像是有网络效应和市场的公司。

Where marketplaces where it  tends to be a 'winner takes all', one company will tend to win.

在那些往往是“赢家通吃”的市场，一家公司往往会获胜。

And network  effects is just, basically, as my network grows, the strength of my company, and the  value of the product or service also grows with it.

而网络效应基本上就是，随着我的网络的增长，我公司的实力，以及产品或服务的价值也随之增长。

Not every company has it,  well when when you do have that, works out great.

不是每一家公司都有，当你有它的时候，效果很好。

There's something to keep in  mind, also, as other things I'm looking to believe about a company, and that is  something that trips up a lot of founders.

还有一些事情需要记住，就像我想要相信的关于一家公司的其他事情一样，这是很多创始人都会遇到的事情。

And so there's two types of beliefs  that I have about a company.

所以我对一家公司有两种信念。

And so there's the threshold belief, which is like,  "What's the default just for them to even succeed?" So oftentimes, for me, it's like,  "Oh, them building it, can they even build it?" That's a threshold belief.

所以有一个临界点的信念，就像是，“他们成功的默认条件是什么？”所以，对我来说，经常是这样的，“哦，他们建造它，他们甚至可以建造它吗？”这是一个临界点的信念。

If they  can't even build it, none of it even matters.

如果他们连建都做不了，那就都无关紧要了。

And so, to me, that question  is not the most important.

因此，对我来说，这个问题不是最重要的。

What will determine whether ...

什么将决定是否.。

"I'm going to win the  lotto." Is a miracle belief.

“我要中乐透了”是一种奇迹般的信仰。

That like, "Oh my God, if I believe that they  can do this, that actually going to be able to take off really well." And  sometimes they're really simple, so if you are heavy engineering team, or doing a B2B,  or enterprise startup, again the default is you have to build it.

就像，“哦，我的上帝，如果我相信他们能做到这一点，那就真的能够取得很好的发展。”有时它们真的很简单，所以如果你是重型工程团队，或正在做B2B，或企业启动，同样默认的是你必须构建它。

So if you  can't even build it, then it's not even going to work, so I don't spend  actually a lot of time looking at that.

所以，如果你甚至不能建立它，那么它甚至不会工作，所以我实际上不会花很多时间研究它。

For me, I'm trying to figure out  success will be determined by how well you can do sales, how well you can  tell the story, how well you can actually convince customers, and work through a sales  process.

对我来说，我试图弄清楚成功将取决于你做销售的能力，你讲故事的能力，你实际说服客户的能力，以及完成销售过程的能力。

I want evidence that shows that you know have to work through that and  make that happen.

我想要的证据表明，你知道必须解决这个问题，并使之成为现实。

And so, all of my work with most of those companies is  like not working on product, it's like, "Hey, all right, let's prove this other thing."  That if you have that, that'll be the thing that actually will help people go  like, "Oh shit, they have this super combo." Let's go some quick examples.

所以，我在这些公司的所有工作就像不是在产品上工作，就像是，“嘿，好吧，让我们证明这另一件事。”如果你有这个，那就是真正能帮助人们去做的事情，比如，“哦，该死，他们有一个超级组合。”让我们来看一些简单的例子。

So YC  is a good one, because we like to think of YC as a startup.

所以YC是一个很好的公司，因为我们喜欢把YC看作是一家初创公司。

So  the problem.

所以问题是。

The way we'd word this is it's hard for founders to raise money  without knowing someone in venture capital.

我们的说法是，创始人在不认识风险投资公司的人的情况下很难筹集资金。

So at the time that it was started, you  basically had to be an insider, and that was the only way you can sort  of get money; and that super sucked.

所以在它开始的时候，你基本上必须是一个内部人士，这是你能获得资金的唯一途径；而且超级糟糕。

And the solution that, basically, Paul Graham came  up with is like, "Invest in companies through an open application, you don't need to  know anyone.

保罗·格雷厄姆提出的解决方案基本上是这样的，“通过一个开放的应用程序投资公司，你不需要认识任何人。

You just tell us your idea, tell us a bit about yourselves, and  that should be enough for you to get funding." Now there's a bunch of unfair  advantages that YC had.

你只需告诉我们你的想法，告诉我们你自己的一些情况，这应该足以让你获得资金。“现在YC有一大堆不公平的优势。

Number one, the founders are pretty incredible.

第一，创始人是相当令人难以置信的。

So Paul Graham had  wrote a textbook on Lisp RTM, wrote the very first worm; he's like amazing programmer.

所以Paul Graham写了一本关于Lisp RTM的教科书，写了第一个蠕虫；他就像一个了不起的程序员。

And they had built and sold the first SAS company that was via web to  Yahoo.

他们建立并出售了第一家SAS公司，这是通过网络卖给雅虎的。

So they were kind of experts at both evaluating technology, and also understanding kind  of startups in that whole process.

所以他们既是评估技术的专家，也是在整个过程中理解初创公司的专家。

The market.

市场。

Basically believe that future billion dollar companies  will be technology companies; they'd be powered by software.

基本上相信未来数十亿美元的公司将是技术公司；他们将由软件提供动力。

And the wonderful thing about tech  companies, especially at that time, was Moore's Law was making it cheaper and cheaper for  software companies to be started and, therefore, they needed a whole lot less money, and  he could make a lot more bets as a result.

关于科技公司的奇妙之处，特别是在当时，摩尔定律使软件公司的起步越来越便宜，因此，他们需要的钱要少得多，因此他可以进行更多的押注。

The product.

产品。

So basically, they  pay the founders, they come for three months, they get some advice, they work on  their product for a relatively small amount of money.

所以基本上，他们付钱给创始人，他们来三个月，他们得到一些建议，他们为他们的产品工作相对较少的钱。

And then at the end of  the time, instead of offering co-working space, they work from their own home, and then  they pitch to a bunch of different investors.

最后，他们没有提供共同工作的空间，而是在自己家里工作，然后他们向一群不同的投资者推销。

And the idea was that would be  so valuable to a potential founder who had no connections, that it would attract a  lot of really great minds, or a lot of people who were hungry to get  into the space.

这个想法对一个没有关系的潜在创始人来说是非常有价值的，它会吸引很多真正伟大的头脑，或者是很多渴望进入这个领域的人。

Acquisition.

收购。

So most of you don't realize this, is PG was able  to sort of build up YC and attract the right talent because he had a  huge reach, or audience, when he got started.

所以你们大多数人没有意识到这一点，是PG能够在某种程度上建立YC并吸引合适的人才，因为当他开始时，他有很大的影响力，或者说观众。

He had written that textbook, yes, but  he also wrote all these popular online essays, and he had a large audience of  his target users, hackers to come and evaluate his product.

他写了那本教科书，是的，但他也写了所有这些受欢迎的在线文章，他有大量的目标用户，黑客来评估他的产品。

And he could acquire them  relatively cheaply just by making a website and letting it be known.

而且他可以通过制作一个网站并让人们知道，就可以相对便宜地获得这些信息。

And then the  last one is, something he didn't even realize when he started YC, and that is  that as the YC alumni network grew, it got more powerful and more valuable over  time.

最后一个是，当他创办YC的时候，他甚至没有意识到，随着YC校友网络的发展，随着时间的推移，它变得越来越强大，越来越有价值。

The results are funded thousands of companies, there's 4,000 founders, they're the CEOs of  some of the biggest companies in the world.

结果得到了数千家公司的资助，有4000名创始人，他们是世界上一些最大公司的首席执行官。

They are over 15 companies worth over  $1 billion.

他们有超过15家公司，价值超过10亿美元。

There's 93 companies with over $100 million, and our total market capitalization is  over $100 billion.

有93家公司的市值超过1亿美元，我们的总市值超过1000亿美元。

I'm going to do one more example with you guys.

我要和你们再做一个例子。

So Wufoo,  this was my startup, and it's an online form and survey builder.

无福，这是我的初创公司，它是一个在线表单和调查构建器。

And so for  us, it was, basically, if your website needs to collect some kind of data, at  some point, but you need to know how to code or hire a programmer to  be able to do it.

所以对我们来说，基本上，如果你的网站需要收集某种数据，在某个时候，但是你需要知道如何编码或者雇佣一个程序员来做这件事。

And so the solution was to build something that what  they see is what they got.

所以解决的办法就是建立一个他们看到的就是他们得到的东西。

Like, basically, a drag and drop visual editor, and  that any non-technical person sort of create.

就像，基本上，一个拖放可视编辑器，任何非技术人员都可以创建。

And then if we did that, we would  solve that sort of specific problem.

然后，如果我们这样做，我们将解决这种特定的问题。

So very quickly, the market.

所以很快，市场。

It's kind of ridiculous,  we were asked in the early days calculate our TAM, but it was like, "Every  website needs a form, I don't really understand, what website doesn't need a form eventually?"  It allowed us to grow really, really quickly, our product was easily shown to be  10x faster against the direct competition with other builders, because it was so much faster  to do the drag and dropping and visually see.

这有点可笑，我们在早期被要求计算我们的TAM，但它就像是，“每个网站都需要一个表单，我真的不明白，哪个网站最终不需要一个表单？”它使我们能够非常快地发展，我们的产品很容易被证明比与其他建筑商的直接竞争快10倍，因为它做拖放和视觉上看的速度要快得多。

And then it'll usually 100x faster  than a lot of traditional routes for very custom forms, for hiring a programmer very  cheaper, because we had this freemium model.

然后，对于非常定制的表单，它通常会比很多传统的路线快100倍，因为雇佣程序员非常便宜，因为我们有这种免费增值模式。

That also led to an acquisition unfair advantage.

这也导致了收购不公平的优势。

And so we actually had started off with building a blog and building an audience  as well.

因此，我们实际上已经开始建立一个博客，并建立一个观众以及。

Started off with 100,000 developers subscribed to our blog, we launched it out  to them after building up that audience for a year; and that's actually what we  applied to YC with.

一开始有100，000名开发人员订阅了我们的博客，在建立了一年的受众后，我们向他们推出了博客；这就是我们实际应用到YC的情况。

Is we had built up this audience, we had proved that  all these other things are in place.

我们已经建立了这个受众，我们已经证明了所有这些东西都在适当的位置。

And then, part of the other acquisition model  is that you could embed these forms on people's websites, and then our users basically  spread our form and software for us as a result; so we never had to  hire any sales people.

然后，另一个收购模式的一部分是，你可以将这些表格嵌入到人们的网站上，然后我们的用户基本上为我们传播我们的表格和软件，因此我们从来没有雇佣任何销售人员。

And the results are, our product was used by every industry,  market and vertical you can imagine.

结果是，我们的产品被你能想象到的每个行业，市场和垂直市场所使用。

Tons of super large companies, and we did this  with a relatively small amount of team.

数吨的超级大公司，我们用相对较少的团队完成了这项工作。

When we were acquired, we were a weird  outlier compared to all the other acquisitions.

当我们被收购时，与所有其他收购相比，我们是一个奇怪的异常者。

The average company raises like $25 million before  an exit, and this is their average return.

平均每家公司在退出前筹集了大约2500万美元，这就是他们的平均回报。

And for Wufoo, we only raised $118,000  for the whole life of the company, and our returns are over 30,000%.

而对于无福来说，我们在公司的整个生命周期中只筹集了118，000美元，我们的回报率超过了30，000%。

Okay, so  in the end, this is very simple exercise, but super enlightening once you actually go  through it, and to try to figure out that narrative and story.

好的，所以最后，这是一个非常简单的练习，但一旦你真正通过它，并试图找出那个叙事和故事，就会非常有启发性。

So I turn  it back to you, go through and try to answer those questions about problems, solution,  your unfair advantage.

所以我把它转回给你，通过并试图回答那些关于问题，解决方案，你的不公平优势的问题。

Figure out, "Where are my holes, do I have one?" And then  the question becomes, "Oh, what do I need to prove, what do I need to  work on to make that happen?" Your startup idea is a hypothesis about why you're  going to grow quickly.

弄清楚，“我的洞在哪里，我有吗？”然后问题就变成了，“哦，我需要证明什么，我需要做什么才能做到这一点？”你的创业想法是关于你为什么会快速成长的假设。

For our next lecture, we're going to talk about the first  ways we try to prove it out to, basically, test our hunches, and that is  by talking to users.

在我们的下一堂课中，我们将讨论我们试图证明这一点的第一种方法，基本上，测试我们的直觉，那就是与用户交谈。©Jotengine Home Docs Contact Privacy DIY
