# Adora Cheung - How to Set KPIs and Goals


Adora Cheung:Alright, so I am going to be talking about setting your KPIs and goals for  early stage startups.

Adora Cheung：好的，所以我要谈谈为早期初创企业设置KPI和目标。

I'm going to be pretty pedantic in this lecture and the reason  why is, doing this correctly is a necessary condition for starting a successful, or building  a successful startup.

我在这堂课上会非常学究式的，原因是，正确地做这件事是成功开始，或建立一个成功的初创公司的必要条件。

The acronym KPI stands for key performance indicator.

缩写KPI代表关键绩效指标。

If you Google around  for it, there are actually many definitions of what this actually means, but for the  purpose of today, for this context, I'm going to define it as a set of  quantitative metrics that indicate how healthy your business is doing.

如果你在谷歌上搜索它，实际上有很多关于这到底意味着什么的定义，但就今天的目的而言，对于这种情况，我将把它定义为一组定量的指标，这些指标表明你的业务有多健康。

This is important because obviously  you should know what state your business is in at all times.

这一点很重要，因为显然你应该随时知道你的业务处于什么状态。

Setting the right  KPIs and goals will objectively tell you if you're doing well, just okay, or bad.

设定正确的KPI和目标将客观地告诉你，你做得很好，只是还好，还是不好。

 Nothing keeps you more grounded, humbled, and realistic about where you are than a bunch  of numbers, because if you interpret those numbers correctly, they don't lie.

没有什么比一堆数字更能让你更加脚踏实地，谦虚和现实的了，因为如果你正确解读这些数字，它们就不会说谎。

It will also  act as a feedback mechanism for whether your current strategy like user acquisition, building new  features, launching new features, and so on and so forth, are actually working.

它还将作为一种反馈机制，以确定您当前的策略(如用户获取、构建新功能、发布新功能等)是否实际起作用。

So, if  you do something and things go up, that's probably good.

所以，如果你做了一些事情并且事情上升了，这可能是好的。

If you do something and  some things go down, that's probably bad.

如果你做了一些事情，有些事情发生了，这可能是不好的。

It will not only help you prioritize your  time, but also course correct.

它不仅可以帮助你确定时间的优先顺序，还可以帮助你正确选择课程。

So, it follows, if you do this incorrectly, if you  set your KPIs and goals incorrectly, you can direct your startup into a bunch of  circles, or if you do it for too long onto the wrong path, it'll lead  to it's unnecessary demise.

因此，随之而来的是，如果你做的不正确，如果你的KPI和目标设置不正确，你可能会把你的创业公司引导到一大堆圈子里，或者如果你在错误的道路上做了太长时间，就会导致不必要的灭亡。

So, what are the right KPIs to set? I'm going to  break this down into two pieces, primary metric and secondary metrics, and most of today  is going to be focused on the primary metric.

那么，要设置的正确KPI是什么？我将把它分成两部分，主要指标和次要指标，今天的大部分时间将集中在主要指标上。

So, every week in startup school  we've asked you in a software to fill out, to define your primary metric, and  then update its current value.

所以，在创业学校的每一周，我们都要求你在软件中填写，定义你的主要指标，然后更新它的当前值。

By definition, you can only pick one, one primary metric,  and it's the metric, if you had to, you'd be willing to bet the whole  company on.

根据定义，你只能选择一个，一个主要指标，这就是指标，如果必须，你愿意把整个公司都押在上面。

So, why just one metric? It's a way to focus and keep things  very simple.

那么，为什么只有一个指标呢？这是一种专注的方式，让事情变得非常简单。

If there's a way to get 90% of the job done with just  one variable, that's better than having a bunch of variables that gets, let's say, 91%  of the job done.

如果有一种方法只用一个变量就可以完成90%的工作，那就比使用一堆变量来完成91%的工作要好得多。

In this case, the job to get done is quickly determining  how well your startup is doing.

在这种情况下，要完成的工作是快速确定你的创业公司做得有多好。

So, what are the characteristics of a good primary  metric? There are four of them.

那么，一个好的主要指标的特征是什么？他们有四个人。

One, so your primary metric should quantify how much  value you're delivering to your customer.

第一，所以你的主要指标应该量化你为客户提供了多少价值。

That is, you obviously want to build something that  people want.

也就是说，你显然想要建立人们想要的东西。

Now, how much do they actually want it? And users often indicate the  value through either training you through money or time.

现在，他们到底想要多少？而且用户通常通过金钱或时间的培训来表明价值。

So, revenue is always the best  metric.

因此，收入永远是最好的衡量标准。

I pay you $100 to use your product, your software, I must at least  value that $100.

我支付你100美元使用你的产品，你的软件，我必须至少价值100美元。

Active users using the product once a week or once a day,  we call that weekly active user or daily active user, is weaker but another good  decent indication of whether you're delivering your value or not.

每周或每天一次使用该产品的活跃用户，我们称之为每周活跃用户或每日活跃用户，虽然较弱，但也是一个很好的指示，表明你是否在实现自己的价值。

The second one here is,  your primary metric must capture whether your product has recurring or enduring value to your  user, or it should anyway.

这里的第二个问题是，您的主要指标必须捕获您的产品是否对您的用户具有重复或持久的价值，或者无论如何都应该如此。

So, for example, in a SAS tool, most SAS tools  use MRR, monthly recurring revenue, as their primary metric.

因此，例如，在SAS工具中，大多数SAS工具使用MRR(每月经常性收入)作为其主要指标。

I commit to forking over 100  bucks a month continuously every month because your product demonstrates to me every month that  it has value to me.

我承诺每月连续支付超过100美元，因为你的产品每个月都向我证明它对我有价值。

Another example is if you're building an online digital daily  newspaper, then obviously DAU, daily active user, is a good one because I expect you  to be delivering content to you that is valuable to you every single day.

另一个例子是，如果你正在构建一个在线数字日报，那么很明显DAU，每日活跃用户，是一个很好的用户，因为我希望你每天都向你提供对你有价值的内容。

So,  hopefully, you'll come back every day.

所以，希望你每天都会回来。

The third one here is your primary metric should  be a lagging indicator for success.

这里的第三个是你的主要指标应该是成功的滞后指标。

So, a common trap that founders do to trick  themselves is by picking a primary metric, let's say something like email signups, because one,  it's easy to move, but while it may eventually influence revenue or actual usage, it  actually doesn't represent real value the best.

所以，创始人欺骗自己的一个常见陷阱就是选择一个主要指标，比如电子邮件注册，因为第一，它很容易移动，但是虽然它最终可能会影响收入或实际使用，但它实际上并不能最好地代表真正的价值。

The best indication is when the value has  already been delivered, it's already occurred.

最好的指示是当价值已经交付时，它已经发生了。

So, when someone has already forked over their time  or money to use it, then that is what a ...

所以，当某人已经支付了他们的时间或金钱使用它，那么这是什么…

That's a definition of  what a lagging indicator is.

这就是滞后指标的定义。

If revenue increases, it's because more customers have already paid  for the product's value versus a potential customer who came to your site, gave you  an email, and maybe they'll sign up one day, or maybe they'll use your product  one day to buy something.

如果收入增加，那是因为更多的客户已经为产品的价值付费，而潜在客户来到你的网站，给你发了一封电子邮件，也许有一天他们会注册，或者也许有一天他们会用你的产品来买东西。

Lastly, your primary metric should be usable as a feedback  mechanism.

最后，您的主要指标应该可以用作反馈机制。

That is, it helps you prioritize strategies and make decisions quickly.

也就是说，它可以帮助您确定策略的优先顺序并快速做出决定。

In a startup,  one of the key things to being successful and getting past product market fit stage  is to iterate very fast, right? So, while you want it to be a lagging  indicator, you also don't want it to lag too much.

在初创企业中，成功并通过产品市场适应阶段的关键之一是快速迭代，对吗？所以，虽然你希望它是一个滞后的指标，但你也不希望它滞后太多。

So, for example, a lot  of people pick MAU, monthly active user, but this is usually not a great metric  because it takes time to understand the impact of movement, especially in a startup this  early as in your startup.

所以，例如，很多人选择mau，每月活跃用户，但这通常不是一个很好的指标，因为它需要时间来理解移动的影响，特别是在这么早的创业公司中。

And so, many things can happen within a month.

因此，很多事情可以在一个月内发生。

And  also, another reason why I don't like MAU generally is because if your user only  comes back once a month, they only value something that you're building once a month.

另外，我不喜欢MAU的另一个原因是，如果你的用户一个月只回来一次，他们只重视你每月构建一次的东西。

 I really question actually if you're solving a real problem.

我真的很怀疑你是不是在解决一个真正的问题。

All right, so you may  have guessed from me talking about these four characteristics of a primary metric that there  are really two primary metrics to pick from.

好的，所以你可能已经从我谈论的主要指标的这四个特征中猜到了，实际上有两个主要指标可供选择。

One is either revenue or active users.

一个是收入或活跃用户。

 Ideally you're picking revenue because nothing tells you more about delivering real value than people  forking over, or handing over real hard earned dollars to you.

理想情况下，你选择的是收入，因为没有什么比人们付钱或把真正辛苦赚来的钱交给你更能告诉你什么是真正的价值了。

And even better is  picking revenue that people keep giving you over, and over, and over again, like monthly  recurring revenue, MRR.

更好的是选择人们不断给你的收入，一次又一次，像每月的经常性收入，MRR。

It's the best test for whether people really want what you're making.

这是人们是否真的想要你做的东西的最好的测试。

 That being said, some people do pick revenue, but a common trap they fall into  is that they don't actually get paid.

话虽如此，有些人确实会选择收入，但他们陷入的一个常见陷阱是，他们实际上没有得到报酬。

And usually, I hear something to the variance  of, "Oh, I'm going to get these ...

通常，我会听到一些变化，“哦，我要去买这些.

I have these 1000 users not paying  me anything.

我有这1000个用户不付钱给我。

I just want to get their feedback and see how they're using the  product and make it a little bit better.

我只想得到他们的反馈，看看他们是如何使用这个产品的，让它变得更好一些。

And then, eventually I'll get them to  pay, or the next 1000 users I'll get them to pay." That's a trap because  free users will give you different types of feedback than users who are actually paying  you.

然后，最终我会让他们付费，或者接下来的1000个用户我会让他们付费。“这是一个陷阱，因为免费用户会给你不同类型的反馈，而不是真正付钱给你的用户。

Paid users are just more serious about the product, and hopefully will be more  serious about giving you feedback.

付费用户只是更认真地对待产品，希望他们会更认真地给你反馈。

So, I urge you to just get paid.

所以，我敦促你直接拿到钱。

All right.

好的。

 So, what are reasons why ...

那么，为什么.

So Kevin, in the early lecture, said 99% of  you should actually use revenue as your primary metric.

所以，凯文，在前面的讲座中说，99%的人实际上应该使用收入作为主要衡量标准。

What are reasons why you should  consider active users? One main one is because building a large audience is actually a  prerequisite to modernization.

您应该考虑活动用户的原因是什么？一个主要的原因是，建立一个庞大的受众实际上是现代化的先决条件。

An example of this is if your business model's advertising-based, like a  Facebook or Google, then yeah, you need millions and millions of users coming back to  your site every day before you can actually get brands and people to buy ads.

这方面的一个例子是，如果你的商业模式是以广告为基础的，比如Facebook或Google，那么是的，你需要成千上万的用户每天都回到你的网站，然后你才能真正让品牌和人购买广告。

 And so, in this case, active users is actually a reasonable proxy for revenue because  eventually when your start up starts making money, it's usually just, a revenues is just  a multiple of your active users.

因此，在这种情况下，活跃用户实际上是收入的合理代理，因为最终当你的初创公司开始赚钱时，通常只是，收入只是活跃用户的倍数。

Another reason is also, but much, much more, much  more rare is, if you have very strong network effects.

另一个原因也是，但是更多，更罕见的是，如果你有很强的网络效应。

That is if you're like  a marketplace that requires tons of users to just get the flywheel going and grow,  then maybe that's a reason for you to focus on active users today versus revenue,  and then, just do revenue later down the road.

这就是说，如果你像一个需要大量用户的市场，只需要让飞轮运转和增长，那么也许这就是你现在专注于活跃用户而不是收入的一个原因，然后，以后再做收入就行了。

Now, that being said, if you're  using active users as a metric, it's important that you define user properly.

现在，也就是说，如果您使用活动用户作为度量，那么正确定义用户是很重要的。

I hear  often, I ask, "Okay, how many users ...

我经常听到，我问，“好吧，有多少用户.

What's your primary metric?" "Active users." "How  many users do you have?" "I have a hundred users?" What does users mean in  that situation? Sometimes, to people, it means a hundred users that just signed up and  gave you an email.

你的主要指标是什么？“活跃用户”。“你有多少用户？”我有100个用户？“在这种情况下，用户意味着什么？有时，对人们来说，它意味着100个刚刚注册并给你发了电子邮件的用户。

Sometimes, it means a hundred users that signed up and started  using your product and then, come back every day for about 10 minutes a day,  which is by far much better than just people just diddle doodling on your site,  right? So, you really need to get that definition correctly and don't trick yourself by  just saying users and having a really easy definition of users.

有时候，这意味着有一百个用户注册并开始使用你的产品，然后每天回来大约10分钟，这比人们在你的网站上涂鸦要好得多，对吧？所以，你真的需要正确地得到这个定义，而不是仅仅通过说用户和拥有一个非常简单的用户定义来欺骗自己。

Another example of users  where it's not exactly users is if you're in a marketplace and there are two  types of customers.

另一个不完全是用户的用户示例是，如果您在市场中，并且有两种类型的客户。

There are two types of users.

有两种类型的用户。

So, a good example is Airbnb.

因此，Airbnb就是一个很好的例子。

 Who are your two users? You have not just the guests but you also have  the host.

您的两个用户是谁？你不仅有客人，还有主人。

So, what are you to do? How do you pick just one? Well,  you pick a value that actually represents them both getting values.

那你要怎么做？你怎么只选一个？好的，你选择一个实际代表它们都得到值的值。

So, in Airbnb's case,  it would be nights booked, right? Another example is Uber.

所以，在Airbnb的情况下，它将是预订的夜晚，对吗？另一个例子是Uber。

So, who are your two  users there? You have riders and you have drivers, and so, an example of a  primary metric you could pick there is weekly trips.

那么，你的两个用户是谁？你有骑手，也有司机，所以，一个你可以选择的主要指标的例子是每周旅行。

Okay? All right.

好吧?好的。

So, there are  always exceptions to the rules, and there is one exception in which your primary metric  is neither revenue or active users.

因此，规则总是有例外，并且有一个例外，其中您的主要指标既不是收入也不是活动用户。

That is if you run a biotech or hard  tech business, and you're still trying to figure out whether the science or tech is  actually going to work.

也就是说，如果你经营一家生物技术或硬技术企业，你仍在试图弄清楚科学或技术是否真的会起作用。

Can you actually build a product? Another definition of this is,  for our biotech, hard tech business is, it often takes a lot of time and  money to get your first product to market.

你真的能制造一个产品吗？对此的另一个定义是，对于我们的生物技术，硬技术业务来说，通常需要花费大量的时间和金钱才能将您的第一个产品推向市场。

So, what's a founder to do, especially  if you have little funding? So, there's two answers to this.

那么，创始人应该做什么，特别是如果你没有多少资金的话？所以，这个问题有两个答案。

One is, if there  are no regulatory issues to doing sales for your product, you should actually do the  same as everyone else.

其一是，如果对你的产品的销售没有监管问题，你实际上应该和其他人一样做。

It should be most likely revenue.

这应该是最有可能的收入。

Your primary metric should be  revenue in the form of paid contracts, LOIs, POC is proof of contracts.

您的主要指标应该是付费合同形式的收入，LOIS，POC是合同的证明。

Proof that  if you build it, they will actually come.

证明如果你建造了它，他们真的会来。

Now, if you are in a space  with regulatory issues, meaning you can't sell it at all without having to go through  like the FDA or some kind of body like that, then your product primary metric  is actually less quantitative per se, and more of a binary thing.

现在，如果你身处一个存在监管问题的领域，意味着你根本不能在没有通过FDA或类似机构的情况下出售它，那么你的产品主要指标实际上是更少的数量本身，而更多的是二进制的东西。

So, it's about  figuring out the technical milestones that you need to demonstrate, to mitigate the risk of  whether the drug or tech is working.

所以，这是关于找出你需要证明的技术里程碑，以降低药物或技术是否起作用的风险。

So, if you have to think about experience  to prove this out, you can ask a question like, what are the minimal things  I need to do to truly answer the question of whether this works or not?  So, if you fall into this category, I urge you to actually just go watch  these two lectures.

所以，如果你必须考虑经验来证明这一点，你可以问这样的问题，我需要做的最小的事情是什么才能真正回答这个问题是否有效？所以，如果你属于这一类，我敦促你真的去看这两堂课。

They are actually fireside chats I did last startup school with Elizabeth  and Eric.

它们实际上是我上一次在创业学校和伊丽莎白和埃里克之间的炉边聊天。

Elizabeth is an expert in biotech, and Eric is an expert in hard  tech, and they actually go through deep, deep, deep, deep, deep dive into how do  you think about your goals and how do you think about your milestones, and what  metrics to actually track? All right, so people have referred to the primary metric as  a North Star metric.

伊丽莎白是生物技术专家，埃里克是硬技术专家，他们实际上非常深入地深入到你如何看待你的目标，你如何看待你的里程碑，以及真正要跟踪的指标是什么？好的，所以人们把主要指标称为北极星指标。

And I actually don't like the term North Star because it  kind of ...

实际上我不喜欢北极星这个词因为它有点.

People have interpreted it as something you just focus on this one  metric and then ignore everything else.

人们把它解释为你只关注这一个指标，然后忽略其他一切。

But like I said earlier, there's no metric that  actually tells a story, that tells 100% of the story.

但就像我之前说的，没有一个指标可以真正讲述一个故事，它可以100%地讲述这个故事。

Maybe 90%, but not 100%.

可能是90%，但不是100%。

 Sometimes, founders fool themselves by literally only tracking their primary metric and nothing else.

有时，创始人欺骗自己，实际上只跟踪他们的主要指标，而不是其他任何东西。

A  common example is just looking at user growth and just ignoring retention completely, but retention  is obviously just as important to user growth as this new user acquisition.

一个常见的例子是只关注用户增长而完全忽略保留，但保留显然与新用户获取一样重要。

So, one  suggestion I have is to select a set of three to five other metrics, secondary  metrics, to pair with your primary metric.

因此，我有一个建议是选择一组三到五个其他指标，次级指标，与您的主要指标配对。

This gives you a good 360 degree overview  of the health of your company, so, there are a ton to choose from, so  many to choose from.

这让你对你公司的健康状况有一个很好的360度概述，所以，有一大堆可供选择，那么多的可供选择。

What you choose is actually very dependent on your business.

你的选择实际上很大程度上取决于你的业务。

Next  week, we're going to have two lectures on these sorts of metrics for consumer.

下周，我们将为消费者举办两场关于这类指标的讲座。

I'll  be giving one on consumer startups, and another YC partner I know will be giving  one on B2B companies, and so, we'll deep dive in these metrics, next week.

我会给一个关于消费者初创公司的，另一个YC合作伙伴我知道会给一个关于B2B公司的，所以，我们下周将深入研究这些指标。

The  key here though is just picking a few, at most, five, three to five, closer  probably to three.

但这里的关键是挑选几个，最多五个，三到五个，可能更接近三个。

You don't want to boil the ocean and pick everything.

你不会想要煮沸海洋和采摘所有的东西。

Usually, it's  fine to track all this kind of stuff, but it's really not a good idea  to optimize too many at once, you'll really just suffer from analysis paralysis.

通常，跟踪所有这类东西是可以的，但一次优化太多并不是一个好主意，你真的会遭受分析瘫痪的痛苦。

All right,  so common question I have when I say, "What is your primary metric? You should  set one," is, "Well, what if I haven't launched yet?" Well, obviously, metrics don't matter.

好的，所以当我说，“你的主要指标是什么？你应该设置一个”时，我经常遇到的问题是，“好吧，如果我还没有启动呢？”很明显，指标并不重要。

 If you don't know what the problem you're solving is, you don't even know who  your customer is yet, you should really just focus on that first.

如果你不知道你要解决的问题是什么，你甚至还不知道你的客户是谁，你真的应该首先专注于这一点。

You'd be really  putting the cart before the horse by worrying too much about this kind of stuff.

你对这类事情担心得太多，真的是本末倒置。

 That said, once you get to the point where you're building the product, it's really  a good idea to get this down, even if you haven't launched yet.

也就是说，一旦你达到了构建产品的地步，即使你还没有发布，把它写下来确实是一个好主意。

By at  least defining your primary metric, you'll be able to think about who your user really  is.

至少通过定义您的主要指标，您将能够考虑您的用户到底是谁。

You get everyone on the same page on who you're targeting, and even you  can use the metrics and goals to hypothesize on how you might get your first  few users.

你让每个人都知道你的目标是谁，甚至你也可以使用指标和目标来假设你如何获得最初的几个用户。

And trust me, nothing is more motivating than staring down the barrel of  zero users and $0 of revenue for weeks on end.

相信我，没有什么比盯着连续几周零用户和零收入的桶更令人振奋的了。

You're going to get very  antsy about launching very quickly and that's actually the fact you want.

你会对快速发布感到非常焦虑，这实际上是你想要的事实。

All right, so  I'm going to go into how do you set goals for your primary metric, for  your KPIs.

好的，所以我将进入如何为您的主要指标设置目标，为您的KPI设置目标。

So, Paul Graham actually wrote a great essay a few years ago called  startup equals growth, and explains why a startup should focus on growth, and I really  urge you to go read it.

所以，Paul Graham在几年前写了一篇很棒的文章，叫做Startup Equals Growth，解释了为什么初创公司应该专注于增长，我真的希望你去读一读。

This section of this lecture draws a lot of  insights from it.

这节课从中汲取了很多见解。

The goal of your startup is to grow your primary metric.

你的初创公司的目标是发展你的主要指标。

By  doing this, it does two things, it proves that you're making something, lots of people  want, and second, it proves you're making something that has a possibility of reaching and  serving all those people.

通过这样做，它做了两件事，它证明你正在做很多人想要的东西，第二，它证明你正在做的东西有可能达到并服务于所有这些人。

Each week, your goal should actually be to set a weekly  growth rate.

每周，你的目标实际上应该是设定一个每周的增长率。

Now, we use weekly increments because startups early on need frequent feedback from  their users to tweak what they're doing.

现在，我们使用每周增量，因为初创公司早期需要来自用户的频繁反馈来调整他们正在做的事情。

But also we use weekly growth rate because  it helps to divide up the progress you need into doable chunks.

但我们也使用每周增长率，因为它有助于将您需要的进度分成可做的块。

So, say your  goal in a couple of months is to get 10,000 daily active users, which requires  growing new users, let's say 10% week over week, to grow 10% this week may  amount to actually just getting a hundred new users, which is a different problem to  solve than trying to get 10,000 new users, right? You should be focusing on what's  directly ahead of you in that week.

所以，假设你的目标是在几个月内获得10，000个每日活跃用户，这需要不断增长的新用户，比方说每周增长10%，本周增长10%可能实际上只获得100个新用户，这是一个与尝试获得10，000个新用户不同的问题，对吧？你应该把注意力放在那一周即将发生的事情上。

Do things that don't scale today, if that's  actually the best way to get those hundred users, and don't worry about the eventual  goal of 10,000 too soon.

做一些今天不能扩展的事情，如果这真的是获得这100个用户的最好方法，不要太快担心最终的10000个目标。

So, naturally, the next question is how fast should [inaudible]  grow? What should this rate actually be? Well, there's no good formula.

因此，很自然地，下一个问题是[听不见]增长的速度应该有多快？这个比率实际上应该是多少？嗯，没有好的公式。

There's no right  formula for this, but one angle that we could tackle it from is looking at  good startups and seeing how fast they were growing in the beginning stages of their  life.

这个问题没有正确的公式，但我们可以从一个角度来解决这个问题，那就是看看好的初创企业，看看它们在生命的开始阶段增长得有多快。

So, I actually went back and I looked at the good startups who pitched  in recent YC demo days.

所以，我实际上回去看了一下最近在YC演示日投放的好的初创公司。

So, if you think about these startups, they were three  months prior, they were all in the phase that you are probably in today.

所以，如果你想到这些初创公司，它们是三个月前的，它们都处于你今天可能处于的阶段。

It  turns out the growth rates range anywhere from 20% to 200% month over month, but  clustered more closely to 20% to 50% month over month, which you could back up,  back it out.

事实证明，每月的增长率从20%到200%不等，但每月的集群更接近20%到50%，你可以备份，备份出来。

It amounts to about five to 10% week over week.

这相当于每周大约5%到10%。

And so,  this chart, just to explain it real quickly, the left hand column is the weekly  growth rate, and then, these are the equivalents that you need to grow by month,  and then what the multiple is by year.

所以，这张图表，为了解释得很快，左边一栏是每周的增长率，然后，这些是你需要按月增长的等价物，然后是按年的倍数。

So, this is actually in line, if  you read that essay, PG wrote a few years ago, which he said, "A good  growth rate during YC is 5% to 7% a week.

所以，这实际上是对的，如果你读了PG几年前写的那篇文章，他说，“YC期间的良好增长率是每周5%到7%。

If you can hit 10%  a week, you're doing exceptionally well." And so, this is the green area, which we've  seen consistently actually in the recent batches of YC.

如果你每周能达到10%，你就做得非常好。“所以，这就是绿色区域，我们在最近几批YC中一直都看到这一点。

So, growth is a little hard  to grok, but if you look at this chart, you'll see that how small variations  in weekly growth rates can make a huge difference on the monthly and yearly time  horizon.

所以，增长有点难以理解，但如果你看一下这个图表，你就会发现每周增长率的微小变化可以在每月和每年的时间范围内产生巨大的差异。

You also get the sense that to get big fast, it actually seems doable  if you have something people want.

你也会有这样一种感觉，如果你有人们想要的东西，那么你就能迅速变大，这看起来是可行的。

On the flip side, if you only manage 1%  weekly growth, it's a sign you haven't figured out things yet.

另一方面，如果你每周只有1%的增长，这表明你还没有弄明白事情的来龙去脉。

It doesn't mean that  you have a horrible business.

这并不意味着你的生意很糟糕。

You can run a great small profitable business growing 1%  week over week, but it's not a good sign that you have a startup with  a billion dollar potential.

你可以经营一家大的、盈利的小企业，每周增长1%，但这不是一个好迹象，表明你有一个有10亿美元潜力的初创企业。

So, you should think about that trade off there and what  you really want out of your business if you're growing at that rate.

所以，如果你以这样的速度增长，你应该考虑一下交易，以及你真正想从你的业务中得到什么。

That said,  the main thing in terms of setting your goals is to think for yourself, is  to define your own goal based on not what others are doing, but what you  think is ambitious and achievable based on the product you're building.

也就是说，设定目标的主要内容是为自己思考，不是根据别人正在做什么来定义自己的目标，而是基于你正在构建的产品，你认为什么是雄心勃勃的，可以实现的目标。

You knew your users  and business better than everyone else.

您比其他任何人都更了解您的用户和业务。

What does success look like for you and what  does being on track look like to you? Here are some general guidelines when defining  a goal.

成功对你来说是什么样子，走上正轨对你来说是什么样子？以下是定义目标时的一些一般指导原则。

All right.

好的。

First, if you're solving a real problem in a large market,  then that means there's a ton of latent demand out there.

首先，如果你在一个大市场中解决一个真正的问题，那么这意味着那里有大量的潜在需求。

People would use up  just about anything to use your product, even if it's half-broken, or half-baked, or just  solves a bit of their problem, which means that startups usually have fast initial growth.

人们几乎会用完任何东西来使用你的产品，即使它是半坏的，半熟的，或者只是解决了他们的一些问题，这意味着初创公司通常会有快速的初始增长。

 That said, where you are today matters.

也就是说，你今天在哪里很重要。

So, if you have a ton of users  and a ton of revenue, you will probably know that at that volume, as a  volume increases, what you need every week to grow gets harder over time.

因此，如果你有大量的用户和大量的收入，你可能会知道，在这个数量上，随着数量的增加，你每周需要增长的东西会随着时间的推移而变得更加困难。

Again, most  startups they grew very quickly and then over some time they kind of, the growth  rate kind of slows down a little bit.

再一次，大多数初创公司发展得非常快，然后经过一段时间，增长速度稍微放慢了一点。

The second one is time to sell.

第二个是卖的时候了。

 So, when you try to set your goal, you need to consider how long it  takes to acquire user and make a sale.

因此，当你试图设定你的目标时，你需要考虑获得用户和进行销售需要多长时间。

For a consumer startup, generally, you have  an app or a website.

对于一家消费者初创企业来说，一般来说，你有一个应用程序或一个网站。

I show up to it, I look at it, I  see if I want it, and then if I do, bam, I buy it, or  I sign up for it, and so, it's instantaneous.

我出现在它面前，我看着它，我看我是否想要它，然后如果我想要，砰，我买它，或者我注册它，所以，它是瞬间的。

For an enterprise startup, where you're  actually probably going through some red tape, you have a bunch of stakeholders you have  to deal, like, you can show up to the company and they're not going to  be able to even buy it right away, because you're maybe not even talking to  the right person.

对于一家企业初创企业，你实际上可能正在经历一些繁文缛节，你有一大堆利益相关者你必须处理，比如，你可以出现在公司面前，他们甚至不能马上买下它，因为你甚至可能没有和正确的人交谈。“。

So, it might take some months to actually get your first sale,  so you will have to take that into account.

所以，可能需要几个月的时间才能真正得到你的第一笔销售，所以你必须考虑到这一点。

Over time, this time to sale  should actually decrease over time, like good enterprise startups, that time to sale goes from  months to hopefully days, if not hours, and so it shouldn't impact your growth rate  in the future, but in the near term it actually might.

随着时间的推移，这个销售时间实际上应该会随着时间的推移而减少，就像好的企业初创公司一样，销售时间从几个月到几天，如果不是几个小时，所以它应该不会影响你未来的增长率，但在短期内它实际上可能会。

Third is, you really  want to focus on organic versus paid users, or paid growth in the beginning.

第三个是，你真的想专注于有机用户与付费用户，或在开始时的付费增长。

Organic  means they discover it through word of mouth.

有机意味着他们通过口耳相传来发现它。

Basically, you're not paying for the user,  they just maybe searching for it and using it themselves.

基本上，你不是为用户付费，他们只是可能自己搜索并使用它。

I think in the early  days, using paid users is actually cheating growth, and you should avoid it as much  as possible.

我认为在早期，使用付费用户实际上是在欺骗增长，你应该尽可能避免它。

Finally, because you're a startup, startups equals growth.

最后，因为你是一家初创企业，初创企业等于增长。

You should focus on exponential  goals and not linear goals.

你应该把重点放在指数目标上，而不是线性目标上。

All right, so in terms of picking the goals, I  think there's two ways to do it.

好的，所以在选择目标方面，我认为有两种方法可以做到这一点。

One, you can just pick a growth rate,  and then, pick up a growth rate that you think you can hit, and if  you hit it, great, you probably should change it.

首先，你可以选择一个增长率，然后，选择一个你认为可以达到的增长率，如果你达到了，很好，你可能应该改变它。

If you're hitting it consistently to  something higher.

如果你一直打到更高的地方。

If you don't, if you're not hitting it, then you should be a  little bit alarmed and you should figure out why.

如果你没有，如果你没有击中它，那么你应该有点惊慌，你应该找出原因。

Another way to do it is  time box and absolute goal.

另一种方法是时间盒和绝对目标。

So, what I mean by for that is, say for  the purpose of startup school, at the end of startup school, how many active users,  or how much revenue do you want to have? What would it look like? What  would something meaningful look like at the end of 10 weeks? Then, go back out  your weekly growth rate, and then, go week to week figuring out the obstacles and  how you should hit that weekly goal.

所以，我的意思是说，为了初创学校的目的，在初创学校结束时，有多少活跃用户，或者你想要多少收入？它看起来会是什么样子？在10周结束时，有意义的事情会是什么样子？然后，回到你的每周增长率，然后，一周又一周地找出障碍，以及你应该如何实现每周的目标。

In the beginning, if you're somewhere close to  zero users today, often you'll get something higher, if you do this method, then 5%  to 7% week over week.

一开始，如果你现在接近零用户，通常你会得到更高的东西，如果你用这种方法，那么每周5%到7%。

Tracking progress, so metrics and goals obviously don't mean anything  if you don't leverage them.

跟踪进度，所以如果你不利用它们，度量和目标显然没有任何意义。

Use these as a motivational tool.

使用这些作为激励工具。

So, one way to  do this is get a piece of paper, draw a forward looking graph of what  the growth you want to hit in the next 10 weeks.

所以，做这件事的一种方法是拿一张纸，画一张前瞻性的图表，说明你想在接下来的10周内实现什么样的增长。

Print it out and  put it everywhere, put it in the top of your desk, put it in the  bathroom mirror, put it on the fridge, and update once a week.

打印出来，放在任何地方，放在办公桌的顶部，放在浴室的镜子里，放在冰箱上，每周更新一次。

This is in  fact what Airbnb founders did in the beginning, and if they hit the numbers, great,  if they did not, then, that's all they would talk about, and so, I would  follow something like this.

这实际上是Airbnb创始人在开始时所做的，如果他们达到了数字，很好，如果他们没有，那么，这就是他们会谈论的所有内容，所以，我会关注这样的事情。

Now, you want to leverage your prior metric and goal to  help you prioritize your time week over week.

现在，您希望利用先前的指标和目标来帮助您每周安排时间的优先级。

So, week to week, you should be  stacking ranking all the ideas you have of how to grow it and make a  good guess on what's going to have the biggest impact for the next week to  meeting your goal, and then, choose accordingly.

所以，一周接着一周，你应该对你所有关于如何成长的想法进行堆积排名，并很好地猜测下一周对实现你的目标有最大影响的是什么，然后，做出相应的选择。

Occasionally, you won't hit your goal for the  week.

有时候，你不会达到本周的目标。

We can dream that our growth will be flawless and look like this, but  in reality, in the beginning it always looks something like this.

我们可以梦想我们的成长将是完美的，看起来像这样，但在现实中，在开始的时候它总是这样的。

It's okay if you  don't hit your goal one or even two weeks in a row as long as  you understand why.

如果你连续一周甚至两周没有达到你的目标也没关系，只要你明白为什么。

You should be always asking yourself what is the biggest obstacle in  my way of hitting my weekly target? How do I overcome this and be obsessive  of this? If you don't know the answer, then, the answer is go talk to  more users and don't spin in circles trying to figure it out yourself.

你应该经常问自己，我实现每周目标的最大障碍是什么？我怎样才能克服这一点并对此产生执着呢？如果你不知道答案，那么，答案就是去和更多的用户交谈，不要转来转去，试图自己找出答案。

A good  startup idea will keep growing at some point, so not hitting your weekly targets week  on end will maybe just help inform you you're not working on the right thing,  or even the right idea.

一个好的创业点子在某个时候会不断增长，所以没有连续一周达到你的每周目标可能只会告诉你没有在做正确的事情，甚至是正确的想法。

Finally, to end, as you already know, our startup school  software asks you to set your primary metric and goals.

最后，正如你已经知道的，我们的创业学校软件要求你设定你的主要指标和目标。

It is important to be  honest about where you are, and one of the best ways to do that is  to fill this out every week.

诚实地告诉你所在的位置是很重要的，最好的方法之一就是每周填写一次。

We've given you the software to do this very  easily.

我们已经给了你很容易做到这一点的软件。

It is not for us, I promise you, it is for you to use  and get in the habit of doing it.

它不是为我们，我向你保证，它是为你使用并养成这样做的习惯。

We hope you fill this out throughout  the course, and moving forward, even after the course you keep doing it.

我们希望您在整个课程中填写此表，并继续前进，即使在课程结束后也是如此。

It's a  good habit to have.

这是个好习惯。

I guarantee you, if you're not already doing this, just adding  this one simple thing to your workflow is going to help you and change things  dramatically.

我向你保证，如果你还没有这样做，只需将这一简单的事情添加到你的工作流程中，就会帮助你并极大地改变事情。

All right, so I am going to take questions.
Speaker 2:So, for a non-profit, what would your suggestion be for primary metric and secondary metrics?
Speaker 1:The question is, for a nonprofit, how should you set your primary metric? The nonprofits  that we actually work with at YC, we want them to get in the state  where they don't have to rely on going out for donations every quarter or every  year, and so, it's actually to develop a revenue model.

好的，我现在回答问题。演讲者2：那么，对于一个非营利性组织，您对主要指标和次要指标的建议是什么？演讲者1：问题是，对于一个非营利性组织，你应该如何设置你的主要指标？我们在YC实际合作的非营利性组织，我们希望他们进入这样一个州，在那里他们不需要每个季度或每年都去募捐，所以，这实际上是为了发展一种收入模式。

And so, while that you're  not looking to seek tons and tons in profit, you should still be having revenue  coming in the door.

因此，虽然你不是在寻找吨的利润，你仍然应该有收入的门进来。

And so, I would probably use that as a yardstick.
Speaker 3:Yeah.

因此，我可能会用它作为衡量标准。扬声器3：是的。

Is LTV ever a good metric to, a secondary metric, to measure for a  startup, or is it too early to even think about it?
Speaker 1:Good question.

LTV是否曾经是一个很好的衡量指标，一个次要指标，衡量一家初创公司，或者现在考虑它还为时过早吗？演讲者1：好问题。

So, the question is, is LTV a good secondary metric or even a  metric to track? So, I'm assuming all of you guys are early stage startups, and  the answer is that you should just ignore it for now.

所以，问题是，LTV是否是一个很好的二级指标，甚至是一个可以跟踪的指标？所以，我假设你们都是早期的初创公司，答案是你现在应该忽略它。

So, LTV is lifetime  value.

所以，LTV是终生价值。

Basically, it's how much revenue your customer is actually going to generate over the  course of the life with your product.

基本上，它是你的客户在你的产品的整个生命过程中实际会产生多少收入。

And that's so hard to estimate or actually  impossible to estimate when you have just a few months of data, or any data  at all.

当你只有几个月的数据，或者任何数据的时候，这是很难估计或者实际上是不可能估计的。

I'm actually going to talk a lot about this next week, but just  to give you a preview, like the jargon LTV is often paired with CAC.

我下周实际上会讲很多关于这一点，但只是为了给你们一个预览，就像行话LTV经常与CAC配对一样。

So,  people are like, "Oh your LTV should be more than CAC." CAC meaning, customer acquisition  cost.

所以，人们会说，“哦，你的LTV应该不仅仅是CAC。”CAC含义，客户获取成本。

I think the more important thing, if you're focused on paid growth, is to  look at payback period in the early days, and hopefully that payback period is zero,  like zero days.

我认为更重要的是，如果你关注的是有偿增长，就是看看早期的回收期，希望回收期是零，就像零天一样。

Like, you are profitable on the first buy.

就像，你在第一次购买时就是有利可图的。

Yeah.

嗯。

Right there.
Speaker 4:If you're an enterprise-focused startup, would you consider tracking on the [inaudible] pipeline value, [inaudible],  or would you still be tracking on everything?
Speaker 1:Yeah, so the question is, if you're an enterprise startup, meaning the sales cycle is  a little bit longer, should you actually be tracking something else? Like, what did you  call it?
Speaker 4:[inaudible] pipeline value.
Speaker 1:Oh, pipeline value, and so, like our LOIs or something like that, so I think  these are great secondary metrics to actually track.

就在那儿。演讲者4：如果你是一家专注于企业的初创公司，你会考虑跟踪[听不到的]管道价值，[听不见]，还是会继续跟踪一切？演讲者1：是的，所以问题是，如果你是一家初创企业，意味着销售周期稍微长一些，你是否应该跟踪其他东西？就像，你叫它什么来着？扬声器4：[听不见]管道值。演讲者1：哦，流水线价值，所以，就像我们的LoI或类似的东西，所以我认为这些是很好的二级指标，可以实际跟踪。

Ultimately, you want the revenue, the actual  revenue, that's booked and that you're getting in the door.

最终，你想要的是收入，实际的收入，这是预定的，而且你正在进入大门。

And so, enterprise startups do  often have metrics like that, that they're tracking in the near term because it's ...

因此，企业初创公司确实经常有这样的指标，他们会在短期内进行跟踪，因为这是…。

 the actual revenue is zero for a really, really long time, but yeah, so, hopefully,  that answers your question.

在很长一段时间内，实际收入为零，但是的，所以，希望这回答了你的问题。

Yes?
Speaker 5:So, about not having the CAC paid users in the beginning.

是?演讲者5：那么，关于一开始没有CAC付费用户的问题。

The consumer are facing,  for example, problems, they [inaudible] a few practical kick-starter.

例如，消费者正面临一些问题，他们[听不见]一些实用的启动器。

Right now, the kick-starter, obviously, are  hard to [inaudible], you have to think through that.

现在，踢球的人，显然很难(听不见)，你必须想清楚这一点。

What percentage of CAC is approved  right here from the sales, from the price of the product in the beginning? Because  in the beginning, obviously, we have to pay something prior to getting more of that  for some cases.
Speaker 1:So, the question is, if you're building a hardware product, often you need to do  marketing campaigns, which requires a bunch of money.

从最初的产品价格，从销售中获得批准的CAC的百分比是多少？因为在开始的时候，很明显，在某些情况下，我们必须在获得更多的钱之前支付一些费用。演讲者1：所以，问题是，如果你正在构建一个硬件产品，你经常需要做营销活动，这需要一大笔钱。

And so, I believe the question is,  what is an ideal CAC to actually spend? Obviously, zero and so, I think when  I think about CAC, I'm thinking about not maybe like a fixed marketing budget.

因此，我相信问题是，一个理想的CAC实际花费是多少？显然，零等等，我认为当我想到CAC时，我考虑的可能不是固定的营销预算。

Like,  maybe you do need to spend like X number of dollars to do a video  for your kick-starter campaign.

比如，也许你确实需要花费X美元来为你的启动活动制作一个视频。

What I mean by CAC is the amount you have to  pay and scale on a per user basis.

我所说的CAC是指你必须支付的金额，并按每个用户进行缩放。

So, to acquire a user I need  to pay $50 moving forward.

因此，要获得一个用户，我需要支付50美元前进。

And so, obviously you don't want to be paying $50  if you're not making $50 from the customer.

因此，如果你没有从客户那里赚到50美元，显然你不想支付50美元。

So, at the very least you should  be breakeven, do not pay more than what the customer is actually giving you on  a profitable basis, on a margin basis.

所以，至少你应该是盈亏平衡，不要支付高于客户实际给你的利润的基础上，在保证金的基础上。

Again, I question whether people actually want to  buy this product.

再一次，我质疑人们是否真的想购买这个产品。

If your whole entire strategy is just paying for users because at  some point, even if you pay for users, they hopefully enjoy the product so much  that they're talking about it, and that word of mouth and referrals or things like  that are actually starting to go.

如果你的整个策略只是为用户付费，因为在某一点上，即使你为用户付费，他们也希望他们非常喜欢产品，以至于他们正在谈论它，而口碑和推荐之类的东西实际上已经开始流行起来了。

And so, your CAC, hopefully, if you have to  start with one, is going down over time.

所以，你的CAC，希望，如果你必须从一个开始，随着时间的推移而下降。

All right, one more.

好了，再来一个。

Speaker 6:If you need funding to build your MVP, is your MVP too ambitious?

演讲者6：如果你需要资金来建立你的MVP，你的MVP是不是太雄心勃勃了

Speaker 1:If you need funding to build your MVP, is your MVP too ambitious?

演讲者1：如果你需要资金来建立你的MVP，你的MVP是不是太雄心勃勃了？

It depends  on, so Michael just gave a whole lecture on MVP, and then, also I'm guessing  you're thinking about his definition of heavy MVP.

这取决于，所以Michael刚刚做了一整堂关于MVP的讲座，然后，我猜你也在想他对重MVP的定义。

I think there are many ways to  answer that question, but if you're on one of those business that requires a lot  of capital to get the first product to market, then you'll have to find other  ways then to obviously get funding, whether it's pre-sales, if you can do pre-sales, that's  the best way to do it.

我认为有很多方法可以回答这个问题，但如果你所从事的业务需要大量资金将第一个产品推向市场，那么你必须找到其他方式来明显地获得资金，无论是售前，如果你能做售前，这是最好的方式来做到这一点。

Paid contracts, just guaranteed revenue upfront to help you  build your product.

付费合同，只是预先保证收入，以帮助您构建您的产品。

The other way, if you have to go to investors, is again,  investor is going to want the situation as de-risked to him or her as possible.

另一种方式是，如果你必须去找投资者，同样，投资者会希望这种情况对他或她尽可能地去风险。

 And so, I would be setting up experiments that help output data that shows that  what I'm building is actually feasible, and actually people want it.

因此，我会建立一些实验来帮助输出数据，这些数据表明我正在构建的东西实际上是可行的，而且实际上人们想要它。

Cool? All right.

很好?好的。

That's  it.

就是这样。

We'll next have [Elia] from segment.

我们下一步将有[Elia]来自Segment。

Thanks.


谢谢。
