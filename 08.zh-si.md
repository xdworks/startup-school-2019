# Gustaf Alstromer - Growth for Startups

Gustaf...tromer:My name is Gustaf.

古斯塔夫.特洛默：我的名字是古斯塔夫。

I'm going to give a talk on growth for startups.

我要做一个关于初创企业成长的演讲。

This  is going to be for some of you guys, not super relevant right now because  you might not launched, and thinking too much about growth when you haven't launched isn't  that relevant.

这将是对你们中的一些人来说的，现在不是超级相关的，因为你可能不会推出，当你还没有推出的时候，想太多关于增长的事情并不是那么重要。

But for those of you that launched, this is hopefully going to be  a good talk.

但对于那些启动的人来说，希望这将是一次很好的谈话。

So I'm going to cover three different things today.

所以我今天将讨论三个不同的问题。

First, I'm going  to talk about product-market fit and retention.

首先，我要谈谈产品-市场适合性和保留率。

The reason that that relates to growth so  much is because working on growth before you have product-market fit and good retention is  not a good idea.

与增长密切相关的原因是，在你拥有产品-市场匹配和良好的保留率之前，致力于增长并不是一个好主意。

The second thing I'm going to talk about is growth channels  and tactics.

我要讲的第二件事是增长渠道和策略。

These things definitely apply after you have launched, and often after you have  a good product-market fit.

这些东西肯定适用于你发布之后，而且通常是在你有了一个很好的产品-市场契合度之后。

You've found something that people really want, and then you want  to scale it up to the larger world.

你已经找到了人们真正想要的东西，然后你想把它扩展到更大的世界。

And lastly, I want to talk about  how you make decisions.

最后，我想谈谈你是如何做决定的。

When you have several people on your team, you want to  start redoing things and you're not really sure exactly if you're making the right decisions  or not.

当你的团队中有几个人时，你想开始重新做事情，而且你不确定自己是否做出了正确的决定。

And this is all the things that apply when you're a little bit  bigger.

当你变大一点的时候，这就是所有适用的东西。

So my background, I learned most of these things I'm going to talk about  at Airbnb.

所以我的背景，我学到了大部分我要在Airbnb上讲的东西。

I worked on the growth team for almost five years from where we  were two people until we were over 100 people on that team.

我在增长团队工作了近五年，从我们两个人开始，直到我们在那个团队中超过100人。

This is the  team back in 2015, most of the lessons I'll talk to today are things I  learned there.

这是2015年的团队，今天我要讲的大部分课程都是我在那里学到的。

Most of you are going to be somewhere on this line.

你们中的大多数人都会在这条线上的某个地方。

Most startups  don't have product-market fit.

大多数初创企业都没有产品与市场的契合度。

Founders tell themself that they do, and they try to convince  themself that this is working, but the truth is for most companies it's not working.

创始人告诉自己，他们是这样做的，他们试图说服自己，这是有效的，但事实是，对大多数公司来说，这并不奏效。

 So that means you're going to be somewhere on this line.

所以这意味着你会在这条线上的某个地方。

People also have this  idea that if I launch my product, it will work.

人们也有这样的想法，如果我发布我的产品，它会起作用。

Somehow it's going to work  if I just tell the world that I built my [inaudible] and is now there.

如果我告诉世界我建造了我的(听不见的)并且现在就在那里，不知何故它会起作用。

 Now unfortunately that's not the case.

不幸的是，事实并非如此。

The world is a really busy place and there  isn't really lots of people waiting for you to launch your product.

这个世界真的是一个忙碌的地方，没有很多人等着你发布你的产品。

They're not standing  there and they're not going to try it the moment you launch it.

他们不会站在那里，也不会在你启动它的那一刻尝试它。

That is  unfortunately not the truth, and for many people who never thought of these questions before  of how do I reach the world, this actually comes as a surprise.

不幸的是，这不是事实，对于许多以前从未想过这些问题的人来说，我是如何到达这个世界的，这实际上是一个惊喜。

People have  been used to working in big companies where this is not a problem.

人们已经习惯于在大公司工作，在那里这不是问题。

People are  used to going to school or other areas where this is just not a problem.

人们习惯于去学校或其他不成问题的地方。

 In this case, when you launch a startup, it's all down to you and it  is going to be a problem in the very, very early days.

在这种情况下，当你启动一家初创公司时，一切都取决于你，在非常早期的日子里，这将是一个问题。

There is a  great article that I recommend for you guys to read on this.

我推荐你们阅读一篇很棒的文章。

This is called  Doing Things that Don't Scale by Paul Graham.

这被称为保罗·格雷厄姆(Paul Graham)所著的“做不按比例缩放的事情”。

He wrote that six years ago.

他六年前写的。

It  is about the early days of the Airbnb story, and the thing that's really important  about this is as a founder, you need to keep two different skillsets in mind  as your company grow.

这是关于Airbnb故事的早期，真正重要的是作为一个创始人，随着公司的发展，你需要记住两种不同的技能。

In the beginning of your company, you're going to do a  lot of things that don't feel right.

在你的公司刚开始的时候，你会做很多感觉不对劲的事情。

They don't feel natural to you because it's  not the kind of thing that you learn in your previous jobs or in school,  especially like the most kind of...

他们对你来说并不自然，因为这不是你在以前的工作或学校里学到的那种东西，特别是像最…

Physical real things that you have to do that  aren't going to be relevant later on.

你必须做的物理上的真实的事情，以后就不相关了。

Well, later on as your company grows bigger,  you're going to be doing a lot of things that are things that relate directly  to software, are things that scale your company.

嗯，后来随着你的公司变得更大，你将会做很多与软件直接相关的事情，这些事情会使你的公司规模扩大。

So these are two things, two skillsets,  that you have to keep in mind at the same time.

所以这是两件事，两套技能，你必须同时记住。

In YC we have  this thing where we tell companies that you just launched, you got to do things  that don't scale.

在YC，我们有这样的事情，我们告诉公司你刚刚推出，你必须做一些不能扩展的事情。

And we got lots of these MBAs that went to school and  said, "Well, this idea does not scale.

我们有很多MBA学生去了学校，他们说，“好吧，这个想法没有规模。

Standing outside of this store, or standing in  this elevator to sell people something, that certainly doesn't scale." Correct.

站在这家商店外面，或者站在电梯里向人们推销东西，这肯定不是规模。“正确。

That does not scale.

这不能伸缩。

 But, that is where everyone needs to start.

但是，这是每个人都需要开始的地方。

And if you went to school and  you learned that you should only work on things that really scale, you're going to  have to unlearn that skill because when you start your company, the most important thing  is going to do things that don't scale.

如果你去了学校，并且你知道你应该只做那些真正有规模的事情，你将不得不放弃这种技能，因为当你开始你的公司时，最重要的事情是去做那些不能扩大规模的事情。

So get comfortable with that idea.

所以接受这个想法吧。

This  is the early days of Airbnb.

这是Airbnb的早期。

So this is sometimes in 2009, they were just  a few people.

所以这是在2009年的时候，他们只是几个人。

The article I mentioned earlier, Doing Things that Don't Scale, tells the  story of the first year or two of Airbnb.

我之前提到的文章“做不按比例做的事情”讲述了Airbnb成立的头一两年的故事。

When the founders came to YC,  they had spent almost a year trying to get Airbnb off the ground.

当创始人来到YC时，他们花了将近一年的时间试图让Airbnb离开地面。

It didn't  really work.

它并没有真正起作用。

This was the first version of the Airbnb website.

这是Airbnb网站的第一个版本。

Airbedandbreakfast.com.

airbedandBreakfast.com。

In fact, the  website itself didn't really speak to what the company does.

事实上，网站本身并没有真正说明公司的业务。

It was started as a  website to offer air mattresses to people that visited design conferences.

它最初是一个网站，向参观设计会议的人提供空气床垫。

And they had to  navigate their way to find the place where Airbnb is today.

他们必须导航找到今天Airbnb所在的地方。

When Airbnb joined YC,  the first question they got from Paul Graham was, who are your users? And at  the time, the site looked something like this.

当Airbnb加入YC时，他们从Paul Graham那里得到的第一个问题是，谁是你的用户？当时，这个网站看起来是这样的。

You click on a listing, and you  had three different pieces of information.

你点击一个列表，你有三条不同的信息。

You had a photo of the host.

你有一张主人的照片。

You have  one photo, in this case, of the building from the outside.

你有一张照片，在这种情况下，从外部的建筑。

And then you have  one map of where that place was.

然后你有一张那个地方的地图

Now at the time, the only comparison to  what a site like this would look like would be Craigslist.

现在，在当时，唯一能与这样一个网站相提并论的就是Craigslist。

So Craigslist wasn't a  lot better than this, so at least it met that criteria.

所以Craigslist并没有比这个好多少，所以至少它满足了这个标准。

But it wasn't something  that would make Airbnb take off.

但这并不是能让Airbnb腾飞的东西。

They didn't really have in the product what made  Airbnb take off.

他们的产品中并没有真正让Airbnb起飞的东西。

The things that were missing is, is a good listing.

遗漏的东西是，是一个很好的清单。

How does  this listing actually look like? Can I trust the host? Lots of things that were  missing in that early product, and how do you learn that? The way they learned  that is they went and talked to their host.

这个列表实际上看起来是什么样子的？我可以信任主持人吗？在早期的产品中缺少了很多东西，你是如何学习的呢？他们了解到这一点的方式是他们去和他们的主人交谈。

On their first week in YC,  Paul Graham told the founders of Airbnb, "You guys go out and meet your host.

在YC的第一周，Paul Graham告诉Airbnb的创始人，“你们出去见你们的主人。

 Where are your host?" "Most of our hosts are in New York.

你的主人在哪里？“我们的主人大部分在纽约。

We don't have  that many, but most of them are in New York." So they flew to New  York, undercover, and not on the cover, they claimed to be hired photographers for Airbnb,  Air Bed and Breakfast.

我们没有那么多，但大多数人都在纽约。“所以他们飞往纽约，卧底，而不是在封面上，他们声称自己是Airbnb，Air Bed和Breakfast的受雇摄影师。

So when they met with all the hosts, they said, "We're  going to come by your home and take photos." They didn't say they were the  founders because that made the company sound much smaller.

所以当他们和所有的主人见面时，他们说，“我们要去你家拍照。”他们没有说自己是创始人，因为这让公司听起来小得多。

They came and met with the  host, and while one of the founders was taking the photos of the listings to  make this look a lot better, the other founder sat down with the host and  asked them questions about how...

他们来了，并与主持人见面，当其中一位创始人正在拍摄上市公司的照片以使其看起来更好时，另一位创始人与主持人坐了下来，并问他们如何…。

What are the challenges you're having with the product? Like  what are the things that are not working? Can you show me how you use  the product? And by doing that, they got for the first time to meet the  people that were their customers, which they really haven't done before, and they got to  see how they use their products.

您在产品方面面临的挑战是什么？比如什么东西不起作用？你能告诉我你是怎么用这个产品的吗？通过这样做，他们第一次见到了他们的客户，这是他们以前没有做过的事情，他们看到了他们是如何使用他们的产品的。

That's doing things that don't scale, and that is  nothing that scales.

那就是做不能伸缩的事情，那不是伸缩的东西。

You can't go and fly to meet every single one of your  customers, but when you start doing that, you will learn things that you can't learn  sitting in front of your computer.

你不能飞去见你的每一个客户，但是当你开始这样做的时候，你会学到一些坐在电脑前学不到的东西。

So they learned that this payouts thing didn't work,  or there was a big UI bug on this page, or it didn't work on  the Internet Explorer well, all these things that you can't learn sitting in front of  your computer.

所以他们了解到这个支付的东西不起作用，或者这个页面上有一个很大的UI bug，或者它在Internet Explorer上不起作用，所有这些你坐在电脑前都学不到的东西。

They went back to San Francisco.

他们回旧金山了。

Back to Y Combinator.

返回Y组合器。

And they sent  an email the morning after and it said, "Here are all the photos we took  of your house.

第二天早上他们发了一封电子邮件说，“这是我们为你的房子拍的所有照片。

They're now up on airbedandbreakfast.com, and by the way, we fixed half  of the bugs that you emailed us about," or, "We fixed the bug that you  told us about yesterday." That made the host love them, and those hosts became the  reason that Airbnb eventually took off.

他们现在airbedandBreakfast网站上，顺便说一句，我们修复了你给我们发来的邮件中一半的漏洞，“或者说，”我们修复了你昨天告诉我们的漏洞。“这让主持人很喜欢他们，而这些主持人就是Airbnb最终起飞的原因。”

Like doing things that don't scale, fixing the product,  making the product work for the early hosts, which became the backbones of the early  days of Airbnb.

比如做一些不能伸缩的事情，修复产品，让产品为早期的主机工作，这成为了早期Airbnb的主干。

So the lesson here is the founders are the ones who make  startups take off.

所以这里的教训是，创始人是那些让初创企业腾飞的人。

The founders, you guys, are the ones who make the startups take  off.

创始人，你们这些家伙，是那些让初创公司腾飞的人。

You're going to have to do unconventional things, you're going to have to do  things that don't feel right, certainly going to do things that you didn't learn in  business school, and you're just going to do the things that are needed.

你将不得不做一些非常规的事情，你必须做一些感觉不好的事情，当然会做一些你在商学院没有学到的事情，而你只是去做那些需要的事情。

And this  is basically what the YC batch is about.

这基本上就是YC批次的意义所在。

When someone joins YC, we're going be  like, "You're going to launch, because that's the most important thing you can do right  now." But once you've launched, it's like, "How do I get users?" It's like, "You  got to figure out how to do it." And it's different for every company.

当有人加入YC，我们会说，“你要发射，因为这是你现在能做的最重要的事情。”但是一旦你启动了，它就像是，“我如何获得用户？”就像是，“你必须想出怎么做。”而且对于每个公司来说都是不同的。

For  many other company, that means sales.

对于其他许多公司来说，这意味着销售。

For other companies, that means doing things that don't  scale.

对于其他公司来说，这意味着做一些不能扩展的事情。

Typically people start with their friends, and then friends have friends, and then hopefully  you get one step further, the people that are now not your friends of friends  and are going to give you true opinion about your company.

通常人们从他们的朋友开始，然后朋友有朋友，然后希望你能更进一步，那些现在不是你朋友的人会给你关于你的公司的真实意见。

Those are the people  you're going to have to reach early on.

这些人就是你要早点接触到的人。

It doesn't really start with, "I launched  my website and I put up Google Ads," or, "I launched my website and somehow  it's been discovered." That's not how companies get started.

它并不是真的开始，“我发布了我的网站，我发布了谷歌广告，”或者，“我启动了我的网站，不知何故它被发现了。”公司不是这样开始的。

That's how they end up much  later, but that's not how they get started.

这就是他们如何结束更晚，但这不是他们开始。

There's only one way to grow when  you're really small, and that is doing things that don't scale.

当你真的很小的时候，只有一种方法可以成长，那就是做不能扩展的事情。

All right.

好的。

Next topic.

下一个话题。

 I'm going to talk about product-market fit.

我要谈谈产品-市场契合度。

This is terminology that probably most of you  have heard of.

这可能是你们大多数人听说过的术语。

This is a thing that's been hard to measure, or hard for  people to say, "Do I have product-market fit or not?" A lot of people like  to tell themself that they do have product-market fit.

这是一件很难衡量的事情，或者人们很难说，“我的产品是否适合市场？”很多人喜欢告诉自己，他们确实有产品与市场的契合度。

It's this thing that we throw  around as a way to say, "My product is great, so now I have product-market  fit." I would argue that there's some ways you can measure product-market fit, and there  are many ways that you can't, so let's talk about the one thing that I  think is the best way to do that.

这是我们抛出的东西，作为一种方式说，“我的产品很棒，所以现在我有了产品-市场的契合度。”我会争辩说，有一些方法可以衡量产品与市场的适合性，但有很多方法你不能，所以让我们谈谈我认为最好的一种方法。

I think that the best way to  figure out if product-market fit is to use data, unbiased data, to understand if you  basically have made something people want.

我认为，判断产品是否适合市场的最好方法是使用数据，不带偏见的数据，来了解你是否基本上已经做出了人们想要的东西。

The two ways that I do that, when I  start that, the first way is I try to figure out what is the metric,  the datapoint, that represents the value of your company? That's the first thing I do.

我这样做的两种方式，当我开始这样做时，第一种方式是我试图找出什么是度量，数据点，代表你公司的价值？这是我做的第一件事。

 The second thing I do is try to figure out, how often should I really  be doing that? A great example might be a startup school.

我做的第二件事是试着弄清楚，我到底应该多久做一次？创业学校可能是一个很好的例子。

The metric here is  like, are people showing up to the video talks at startup school? How often is  that? It's every week.

这里的衡量标准是，人们是否出席了创业学校的视频讲座？多久一次？每周一次。

All right.

好的。

That's pretty easy.

这很容易。

But most companies can be defined  this way.

但大多数公司都可以这样定义。

Let's give some examples.

让我们举几个例子。

So Airbnb.

所以Airbnb。

What is the metric represents the value?  Well, it's the bookings and the stays.

表示值的度量是什么？嗯，是预订和住宿。

It's not the searches.

不是搜查。

Search is not that.

搜索不是这样的。

 It's going to be the bookings and the stays.

这将是预订和住宿。

When I travel Airbnb, I've experienced  the value.

当我在Airbnb旅行时，我体验到了它的价值。

So now I know what Airbnb is about.

所以现在我知道Airbnb是什么了。

How often do people do  this? Well, travel is actually mostly an annual thing.

人们多久这样做一次？嗯，旅行实际上基本上是一年一度的事情。

You don't really travel every month.

你并不是每个月都去旅行。

 Most people don't do that.

大多数人不会那样做。

So when we were measuring retention, at Airbnb we're looking  at annual.

所以当我们测量保留率时，在Airbnb，我们看到的是年度保留率。

Let's look at Instagram.

让我们看看Instagram。

What's the expected use case of Instagram? It's basically  just coming back to Instagram.

Instagram的预期使用情形是什么？基本上就是回到Instagram上。

Most people are not expected to post photos every day.

大多数人并不期望每天都发布照片。

 It's just going to be coming back to Instagram and viewing photos.

它只会回到Instagram并查看照片。

That's what most  people do.

大多数人都是这么做的。

And that's fine.

那很好。

That's actually what they want.

这就是他们想要的。

They want some people to  post photos sometimes, but most of the time just coming back is good enough.

他们有时想让一些人张贴照片，但大多数时候只要回来就足够了。

How  often? Probably every day.

多久一次？可能每天都有。

Let's think of a B2B company.

让我们考虑一个B2B公司。

Gusto.

兴趣。

So for Gusto, the  most valuable thing that they do for their customers is their own payroll.

所以对于Gusto来说，他们为客户做的最有价值的事情就是他们自己的工资单。

And the  payout money for employees, they are the employees of Gusto's customers.

而员工的奖金，他们是Gusto的客户的员工。

So how often do  you run payroll? Well, depends.

那你多久发一次工资单？看情况。

Probably every bi-weekly or monthly.

可能每两周或每月一次。

And by measuring these two  things, how many people am I running payroll, and are they continually running payroll with  me? That's probably the best way to figure out if people enjoy using Gusto, if  they're going to switch to some other payroll provider.

通过测量这两件事，我有多少人在运行工资单，他们是否一直在和我一起运行工资单？这可能是确定人们是否喜欢使用Gusto，如果他们打算切换到其他薪资提供商的最好方法。

And finally, Lyft.

最后，莱夫特。

You might want  to think it's rides here, that rides is the best metric here.

你可能会认为这里是骑行，那是这里最好的衡量标准。

It's actually riders.

实际上是骑手。

 Like the people that are taking the rides are the ones that matter.

就像乘坐游乐设施的人才是最重要的。

Because it's  the individuals that we want to measure here, and we're not necessarily want to measure  the action that they take.

因为我们想在这里衡量的是个人，我们不一定要衡量他们采取的行动。

And that's probably weekly to monthly.

这可能是从每周到每月。

So now we have  these two metrics.

所以现在我们有了这两个指标。

We have a bunch of examples of those companies.

我们有很多这些公司的例子。

Let's put them  on a graph.

让我们把它们放在图表上。

One piece on the graph is going to be the metric, and  the other one is going to be the time window.

图上的一个部分将是度量，另一个将是时间窗口。

So every single time window,  we can put some percentage of those people on the graph.

因此，每一个时间窗口，我们可以把这些人的一些百分比放在图表上。

So let's give an  example.

让我们举个例子。

On week zero in the case of Lyft, you've got 100% drivers.

在Lyft的情况下，在第0周，你有100%的司机。

So what  do I mean by that? I basically mean that if I had...

我这么说是什么意思？我的意思是如果我有.。

Like say I  had 10 riders this week that rode with Lyft, they would be calculated on the  week zero.

就像说我这周有10个骑手和Lyft一起骑马，他们将被计算在第零周。

Now how many of the riders that I had last week are now  traveling with Lyft this week? That is your week one number.

我上周的车手中有多少人这周和Lyft一起旅行？这是你第一周的号码。

And the week two  number.

和第二周的数字。

And the week three number.

还有第三周的数字。

Now why is this important? Because we're trying to  measure repeat usage.

为什么这很重要？因为我们正在尝试测量重复使用。

Repeat usage is the best, most unbiased way to figure out if  someone is liking your product.

重复使用是判断某人是否喜欢你的产品的最好、最公正的方式。

It's more true than what they tell you.

这比他们告诉你的更真实。

They might  tell you things, but what they do is going to be the most important thing.

他们可能会告诉你一些事情，但他们所做的将是最重要的事情。

 So most companies can be defined this way, even if you have a B2B contract  company that do annual contracts, measuring say what do people do with my product, could  be a really good way on like this regular basis.

所以大多数公司都可以这样定义，即使你有一个做年度合同的B2B合同公司，衡量人们用我的产品做什么，可能是一个非常好的方式，就像这样定期。

So even if they'll pay  for Gusto on an annual basis, which they don't do, measuring the activity using Gusto  on a regular basis, let's say bi-weekly or monthly, is the way to figure out  if people are actually using the product.

所以，即使他们每年支付Gusto的费用(他们不会这样做)，定期使用Gusto测量活动，比如说每两周或每月一次，是确定人们是否真的在使用该产品的方法。

So most of the ideas, even your B2B  or consumers, could be plotted on this line.

所以大多数想法，甚至你的B2B或消费者，都可以画在这条线上。

Now why is this important? Well, if  you're ever going to raise money, this is a graph that investors are going to  ask for.

为什么这很重要？嗯，如果你打算筹集资金，这是一个投资者会要求的图表。

How much retention do you have? Are people actually repetitively using your product?  Those are things they're really curious about because they know there are other metrics that  you might have that don't matter.

你有多少留成？人们真的在重复使用你的产品吗？这些都是他们真正感兴趣的事情，因为他们知道你可能拥有的其他指标并不重要。

This is a sign of a bad product.

这是劣质产品的标志。

Basically  every single week after I started using this product, fewer and fewer and fewer people  continued to come back to use the product.

基本上在我开始使用这个产品后的每一周，都会有越来越少的人继续回来使用这个产品。

So this graph can be plotted and  basically show that this wasn't a good product.

所以这个图表可以画出来，基本上表明这不是一个好产品。

This however is a good product.

然而，这是一个很好的产品。

Every  week, it eventually flattens out, and the people that stop on the products, stop using  the product.

每周，它最终都会趋于平缓，而那些停在产品上的人，就会停止使用产品。

And eventually here at week 8, 9, 10, we have a flat line  of people that continues to use the product every single week.

最终，在第8周，第9周，第10周，我们有了一条平坦的路线，每周都会继续使用该产品。

That means that they  are retained.

这意味着它们被保留了下来。

You have product-market fit for those users for this product.

您的产品市场适合这些用户使用此产品。

So I'm not  going to ask you these questions but, here are two examples of two companies that  I would argue have product-market fit.

所以我不会问你这些问题，但是，这里有两个公司的例子，我认为它们的产品与市场相匹配。

The first one here has 30% after two months,  and 21% after 20 months.

这里的第一个在两个月后有30%，在20个月后有21%。

This is pretty good.

这个不错。

So you kept a fifth of  your users 21 months later.

因此，21个月后，您保留了五分之一的用户。

Or 20 months later.

或者20个月后。

StoreDash.

StoreDash

StoreDash have a monthly retention  of 20% two years later, a year and a half later.

两年后，一年半后，StoreDash每月的保留率为20%。

Here's another company.

这是另一家公司。

More  like a B2B company.

更像是B2B公司。

So 80% retention after one month, and then 30% after 60  months.

因此，一个月后保留80%，60个月后保留30%。

Is really good.

真的很好。

This is a really good product.

这是一个非常好的产品。

Very sticky.

非常粘人。

People like this  product and they don't stop using it.

人们喜欢这个产品，而且他们不会停止使用它。

It's GitHub.

是GitHub

So retention is the best way  to measure product-market fit.

因此，保持是衡量产品-市场适合性的最好方法。

Let's talk about specific things you might want to...

让我们谈谈你可能想要的具体事情.。

That some  people think is a better way.

一些人认为这是一种更好的方式。

I'll argue that they're not.

我会争辩说他们不是。

So here's worse ways  to measure product-market fits.

所以这里有更糟糕的方法来衡量产品与市场的契合度。

Net Promoter Score.

Net Promoter评分。

Why is it not good? Well, you can  just Google the best products and best companies in the world.

为什么不好？嗯，你可以只搜索世界上最好的产品和最好的公司。

They all have a  bad Net Promoter Score.

他们都有一个糟糕的Net Promoter分数。

Like the iPhone, Apple, all of them have bad Net Promoter  Scores.

像iPhone、苹果一样，它们都有糟糕的Net Promoter分数。

Like it doesn't necessarily correlate with good products.

就像它并不一定与好的产品相关。

It correlates with perceptions of companies.

它与人们对公司的看法有关。

 Surveys.

调查。

The problem with surveys is they are going to be biased.

调查的问题是他们会有偏见。

So if you  ask your users, you're going to have some level of bias.

所以如果你问你的用户，你会有一定程度的偏见。

There are good ways  to use surveys to improve your products, but it's not going to be the best  way to figure out this metric.

有一些很好的方法可以使用调查来改进你的产品，但这不是找出这个指标的最好方法。

There is one cool question you can ask a  user which is, how would you feel if you could no use this product? Sometimes  this works.

有一个很酷的问题，你可以问一个用户，那就是，如果你不能使用这个产品，你会有什么感觉？有时候这很管用。

It can give you an idea, but I wouldn't do it instead of  retention.

它可以给你一个想法，但我不会这样做，而是保留。

Always try to always try to find a way to measure retention.

总是尝试总是试图找到一种方法来衡量保持率。

What are  some bad metrics for product-market fit? These are not the kinds of things you want  to throw around as like evidence for your product working.

产品与市场的适合性有哪些不好的衡量标准？这些不是你想要的东西，就像你的产品工作的证据一样。

Registered users.

注册用户。

Really bad.

真的很糟糕。

Does  not say anything about repeat usage or if they liked you or not.

不会说任何关于重复使用或者他们是否喜欢你的话。

Visitors.

访客。

Also  bad.

也很糟糕。

Does not say anything about whether your product is going to be valuable.

不会说任何关于你的产品是否会有价值的事情。

Conversion  rate.

转化率。

We have this conversion rate of visitors to something else.

我们有游客对其他事物的转化率。

Well, that doesn't really  say much because you don't know what people you're converting.

嗯，这并不能说明什么，因为你不知道你要转化的是什么人。

You don't know who they  are.

你不知道他们是谁。

So this does not say much about product-market fit either.

所以这也不能说明产品与市场的契合度。

And finally, something that  should be a paid product, you're giving it away for free, is not a good  sign of product-market fit.

最后，一些应该是付费产品的东西，你免费赠送，这不是产品-市场契合度的好迹象。

Like you want to figure out if people are willing to  pay for it because price, if someone says, "I love this if it's free, but  if it costs money, I'm not going to use it," that's pretty bad.

就像你想知道人们是否愿意为它买单，因为价格，如果有人说，“如果它是免费的，我喜欢它，但如果它花了钱，我不会使用它，”这是相当糟糕的。

That's not  going to work out for you.

这对你来说是行不通的。

So you want to make sure that the people  that are doing something like this on this graphy, if it's expected you pay for  a product, they should be paying for the product.

所以你要确保在这张图上做这种事情的人，如果期望你为一个产品付费，他们应该为该产品付费。

All right.

好的。

Next section.

下一节。

Let's talk  about growth channels and tactics.

让我们谈谈增长渠道和策略。

This section really applies if you have product-market fit.

如果你有适合市场的产品，这一部分确实适用。

If  most of the people that come to your product go down the drain right away  and they never come back, this section doesn't matter.

如果大多数来你的产品的人马上就下水了，他们再也不会回来了，这一部分并不重要。

Like why would you work on  trying to get more people to a product if no one is using your product  anyway? If most people are just churning, and like they try it once and then  they don't come back, like don't work up this stuff.

比如，如果没有人使用你的产品，你为什么还要努力让更多的人使用你的产品呢？如果大多数人只是搅拌，喜欢他们尝试一次，然后他们就不会回来，就像不要做这个东西。

Wait with this stuff until  you have some people that care about your product and you can try to use  some of these channels to reach those people specifically.

等待这个东西，直到你有一些人关心你的产品，你可以尝试使用这些渠道中的一些来联系那些特定的人。

There's really two ways that you  can grow at scale.

实际上有两种方式可以实现规模增长。

So when I looked at that team, so the photo of  the Airbnb team, they worked on two things.

所以当我看着那个团队，所以Airbnb团队的照片，他们做了两件事。

They either worked on what I call  product growth or conversion rate optimization.

他们要么致力于我所谓的产品增长或转化率优化。

What this means is you have typically engineers, designers,  data scientists, products managers, working on improving specific parts of your product to get more  people through that funnel.

这意味着你有典型的工程师，设计师，数据科学家，产品经理，致力于改进你的产品的特定部分，让更多的人通过这个漏斗。

So a good example...

所以一个很好的例子.。

I'm going to give you some examples  in a second.

我马上给你们举几个例子。

But that's basically what I define as the first section.

但这基本上就是我定义的第一部分。

Most of  those people in that photo were in this category.

照片中的大多数人都属于这一类。

They were engineers, designers, product managers,  and data scientists.

他们是工程师、设计师、产品经理和数据科学家。

The second group is what I call growth channels.

第二类是我所说的增长渠道。

Growth channels is  basically platforms in the world that people tend to discover products on.

成长渠道基本上是世界上人们倾向于发现产品的平台。

I'm going to  give you some specific examples.

我会给你一些具体的例子。

Google.

谷歌。

It's huge platform for new products to be discovered.

这是发现新产品的巨大平台。

 Anything that you want to use that is a rare behavior in your life, Google.

谷歌，你想使用的任何东西都是你生活中罕见的行为。

 That's what you do.

这就是你要做的。

Insurance.

保险。

I forgot the insurance.

我忘了保险。

Google.

谷歌。

I'm going to find a  doctor.

我去找医生。

Google.

谷歌。

Everything you do rarely is going to be Google.

你很少做的每一件事都将成为谷歌。

Which means lots of  products are being discovered on Google.

这意味着在谷歌上发现了很多产品。

And growth channels like Google is an extremely important  one for many companies.

而像谷歌这样的增长渠道对于许多公司来说是极其重要的。

Another one might be Facebook-Instagram.

另一个可能是Facebook-Instagram。

Advertising on Facebook and Instagram in  critical to companies' growth these days.

Facebook和Instagram上的广告对公司的增长至关重要。

What I mean by growth channels I mean is  basically other platforms but your website or your app.

我所说的增长渠道基本上是指其他平台，而不是你的网站或应用程序。

So let's talk about conversion rate  optimization.

因此，让我们谈谈转化率优化。

What does it mean? Every single step of your product experience is a funnel  that like the retention curve, can be measured.

什么意思？您的产品体验的每一步都是一个漏斗，就像保留曲线一样，可以测量。

You can have a metric, and I  think [Ilia] talked about this since earlier shop school talk when he built funnels.

你可以有一个量度，我认为[Ilia]早在他建造漏斗的时候就已经谈论过这个问题了。

If  you put a metric on every single page in your product, you will know what  percent of people that make it from the first page, say the home page, to  the booking page.

如果你在产品中的每一个页面上都放上一个指标，你就会知道从第一个页面(比如主页)到预订页面的人所占的百分比。

In the case of Airbnb, we call the home page P1, the  search results page P2, and then the booking page, and the listing page P3, and  then the booking page was P4.

在Airbnb的情况下，我们调用主页P1，搜索结果页面P2，然后是预订页面和列表页面P3，然后预订页面是P4。

Four pages.

四页。

That was the entire website.

那是整个网站。

Now what's  the funnel, what percent of people make it from P1 to P4? What percent? Not  that many.

现在的漏斗是什么，从P1到P4的人数百分比是多少？什么百分比？不是很多。

1%.

1%

2%.

2%。

Most people don't make it that far.

大多数人都不会走那么远。

Your job is to  figure out how many people make it that far, why are they dropping off, what  can I do to increase that number? That's basically multiple teams or multiple people at  startups that do work on those things.

你的工作是弄清楚有多少人能做到这一点，为什么他们会下降，我能做些什么来增加这个数字？这基本上是指多个团队或多个人在初创公司从事这些工作。

Every single step in that funnel is going  to have some sort of drop-off for some reason.

由于某种原因，漏斗中的每一步都会有某种下降。

They might be that the content  on the page is not suited for them.

他们可能是页面上的内容不适合他们。

I land on Airbnb.

我在Airbnb上降落。

All the content  speaks to Millennials.

所有的内容都是千禧一代的心声。

I have a family.

我有家庭。

There's not good content.

没有好的内容。

I land on some  other website, and the content doesn't speak to me because I'm not the right customer.

我登陆了其他一些网站，但内容并没有对我说话，因为我不是正确的客户。

 That's one example of a drop-off that you can fix with content, changing the content.

这是一个可以使用内容修复的下拉示例，更改内容。

 Another one might be I land on the website.

另一个可能是我登陆网站。

It doesn't work because Internet Explorer  is not optimized for that, is not optimized for that.

它不起作用，因为Internet Explorer没有针对此进行优化，也没有针对此进行优化。

You're going to drop off.

你会掉下去的。

 So you got to fix that too.

所以你也得解决这个问题。

There are lots of different reason people want  to drop off.

人们想要放弃有很多不同的原因。

Here's some specific things that people tend to work on when they  work on conversion rate optimization.

下面是人们在进行转换率优化时倾向于做的一些具体事情。

Internationalization.

国际化。

If your website or your product is international, translating  it, the product, is really a good idea.

如果你的网站或产品是国际的，翻译它，产品，真的是一个好主意。

We saw that at Airbnb.

我们在Airbnb上看到了。

I've seen  that at Facebook.

我在Facebook上见过。

I've seen that at many other companies where translation is really, really  important.

我在许多其他公司看到了翻译非常重要的地方。

Authentication.

身份验证。

Most products have some flow where you're signing up.

大多数产品在你注册的地方都有一些流程。

Now that flow, probably  your products too, have some kind of authentication flow.

现在，流，可能也是您的产品，都有某种身份验证流。

That flow is very...

那股水流非常.。

Critical and  the users are kind of vulnerable in that case because they don't really have time  for too much friction.

关键，用户在这种情况下很容易受到攻击，因为他们没有时间进行太多的摩擦。

So if it's not working perfect, they might just go to  the next website.

因此，如果它的工作不完美，他们可能只会转到下一个网站。

So make sure the authentication flow works really well.

因此，请确保身份验证流工作得非常好。

Look at the  best websites in the world.

看看世界上最好的网站。

Look at Pinterest.

看看Pinterest

Look at Airbnb.

看看Airbnb。

Look at some of  those sites.

看看这些网站中的一些。

They have teams optimizing these flows, the authentication flow.

他们有团队优化这些流，即身份验证流。

Copy what they do.

复制他们所做的。

 They've probably figured it out.

他们可能已经想出来了。

They've spent a lot of time optimizing.

他们花了很多时间优化。

Onboarding.

入职。

This is  a huge effort, specifically for products that need a lot of involvement from the users  to be able to become active users.

这是一个巨大的努力，特别是对于需要大量用户参与才能成为活跃用户的产品而言。

So a lot of questions you might want  to ask early on in a new product, the more you can onboard your users  by asking them questions that make the experience better, the more active and the more  retained they'll be.

所以在新产品的早期你可能会问很多问题，你可以通过问用户更好的问题来加入你的用户，这样他们就会更活跃，更留住他们。

So onboarding, there's lots of things you can do.

所以入职后，你可以做很多事情。

And finally, purchase  conversion.

最后，购买转换。

When you're about to purchase, there are a lot of things around urgency and  scarcity and just user flow and UI, all of these things matters, and that's another  great example of conversion optimization.

当你准备购买时，有很多事情围绕着紧迫性和稀缺性，只有用户流和UI，所有这些都很重要，这是转换优化的另一个很好的例子。

So let's talk about growth channels.

所以，让我们谈谈增长渠道。

So again, don't get  here until you have some good sense that this is something people want.

所以，再说一次，在你有一些好的感觉，这是人们想要的东西之前，不要来到这里。

First one.

第一个。

 Like I said earlier, if this is a rare behavior, most new ideas are rare  behaviors either because they don't exist yet, or because they're not something you do every  day.

就像我之前说的，如果这是一种罕见的行为，那么大多数新想法都是罕见的行为，要么是因为它们还不存在，要么是因为它们不是你每天都在做的事情。

We tend to go to Google to learn about things that we don't do  very often.

我们倾向于去谷歌了解我们不经常做的事情。

So that's why if that is the kind of product that you have,  being on Google is going to be really important.

所以这就是为什么如果这是你拥有的那种产品，在谷歌上将是非常重要的。

You can be either on Google  through paid marketing, through SEM, or through SEO.

您可以通过付费营销、SEM或SEO在Google上。

I'll talk about it in a second.

我一会儿再谈这件事。

 Second.

第二。

Does your product, the people already share your product through word of mouth? So  some products are viral in its nature because it sound really exciting to talk about.

你的产品，人们已经通过口碑分享你的产品了吗？所以有些产品在本质上是病毒性的，因为它听起来真的很令人兴奋。

 Lyft and Uber and Airbnb are examples of those.

Lyft、Uber和Airbnb就是这样的例子。

If that's the case, you want  to make sure you're focused on virality and referrals.

如果是这样的话，你要确保你专注于病毒学和推荐。

What does that mean? It means  you're building into your product the flow that friends can tell other friends about the  product.

那是什么意思？这意味着你正在将朋友可以告诉其他朋友有关产品的流程构建到你的产品中。

Referrals is a way that you can do that by giving some kind of  financial incentive.

推荐是一种你可以通过给予某种经济激励来做到这一点的方法。

Does the product get better if you have more users? Well, this is  true of marketplaces, but it's specifically true for anything that's social.

如果你有更多的用户，产品会变得更好吗？嗯，这对市场来说是正确的，但是对于任何社交的东西都是如此。

So if you think  of a LinkedIn or an Airbnb, sorry LinkedIn or Facebook, then having more people on  the product is going to make it better.

所以，如果你想到LinkedIn或Airbnb，对不起，LinkedIn或Facebook，那么产品上有更多的人会让它变得更好。

So it's going to be really important  for you to get more people, and those people on your site's going to be  the ones doing it.

所以对你来说，吸引更多的人是非常重要的，而你网站上的那些人就是做这件事的人。

So you want to figure out a good viral loop.

所以你想找出一个好的病毒循环。

When  you sign up to LinkedIn, the first thing they ask you is to invite more  people.

当你注册LinkedIn时，他们问你的第一件事就是邀请更多的人。

That's because your experience get better when there are more people on LinkedIn.

这是因为LinkedIn上的人越多，你的体验就越好。

Now  many products do work this way, and this can be perfected and the ones that  really succeed in the world of...

现在许多产品确实是这样工作的，这可以被完善，并且在世界上真正成功的那些…

Social products are the ones that really nailed this  down.

社会产品才是真正确定这一点的。

They figure out how to do this really well.

他们知道如何把这件事做得很好。

Many people that make social  apps underestimate how important it's going to be to get your friends on that product.

许多制作社交应用程序的人低估了让你的朋友使用该产品的重要性。

 If you can make a list of all your customers, even if that list is  100,000 or 500,000, as long as it's not mainstream enough they'll be in the tens  of millions, you're probably going to do sales.

如果你能列出你所有客户的名单，即使这个名单是10万或50万，只要它不够主流，他们就会在数千万，你可能会去做销售。

You'll make that list, and you start  contacting those people.

你会列个名单，然后开始联系那些人。

Why make it any more complicated? Why go out and reach the  world for people if they're only a few people that you really want to reach?  So most companies in YC these days, if I ask them this question, can you  make a list of your customers? Yeah.

为什么要把它弄得更复杂呢？如果人们只是你真正想要接触的几个人，为什么还要出去为他们接触世界呢？所以现在YC的大多数公司，如果我问他们这个问题，你能列出你的客户名单吗？嗯。

Right.

右（边），正确的。

Make that list.

列个单子。

Start listing them out.

开始把它们列出来。

 Who are the people? Decision makers in those companies you're trying to sell to.

这些人是谁？你想卖给那些公司的决策者。

These  people.

这些人。

Make the list.

列个单子。

Email addresses.

电子邮件地址。

Phone numbers.

电话号码。

Trying to figure out how to reach  them.

想办法找到他们。

But start by making the list.

但从列清单开始。

Don't make it complicated by going out in  a world that most people aren't going to be relevant for for your product.

不要因为走进一个大多数人都与你的产品无关的世界而使事情变得复杂。

And  finally, this is a channel that nowadays is bigger than it ever has been, and  more important than it ever has been, which is how if you look at how  the entire world of startups has changed in the last 10 years, more and more  of them are churning more money, and therefore, getting what's called a high LTV, high  lifetime value.

最后，这是一个比以往任何时候都更大，也比以往任何时候都重要的频道，这就是如果你看看整个初创企业世界在过去10年里是如何改变的，他们中越来越多的人赚到了更多的钱，因此，获得了所谓的高LTV，高终生价值。

By getting high lifetime value, you're enabling the ability to buy paid advertising.

通过获得较高的终生价值，您可以购买付费广告。

 If you don't have people paying for your product, or you're making money from your  product, you should not be spending time on online marketing.

如果你没有人为你的产品买单，或者你正在从你的产品中赚钱，你就不应该把时间花在线营销上。

Now the truth is is  that most companies these days are charging for the products.

现在的事实是，现在大多数公司都对产品收费。

They are making money from  the product, and therefore they spend money on online marketing.

他们从产品中赚钱，因此他们把钱花在线营销上。

If that's true for you,  this can be an extremely powerful channel.

如果这对你来说是真的，这可能是一个非常强大的渠道。

The biggest mistakes founders make is they start  working on online marketing when they don't have people paying for the products.

创始人所犯的最大错误是，当他们没有人为产品付费时，他们就开始进行在线营销。

Here's an  insight you probably didn't think of.

这里有一个你可能没有想到的洞察力。

Most really big companies didn't use all of those  channels.

大多数真正的大公司并没有使用所有这些渠道。

They use one or two channels.

他们使用一个或两个频道。

So think of a TripAdvisor.

所以想想TripAdvisor

How is TripAdvisor  big? SEO.

TripAdvisor有多大？SEO

You guys type in something on Google, you land on TripAdvisor, and that's  how you found this website.

你们在Google上输入一些东西，然后登陆TripAdvisor，这就是你们如何找到这个网站的。

Most companies have a setup where there's going to be  one or two channels that really matters.

大多数公司都有一个设置，其中会有一个或两个真正重要的渠道。

If you think of Pinterest, SEO is the  real way how Pinterest is growing.

如果你想到Pinterest，SEO是Pinterest成长的真正方式。

You type something in on Google, the order access  the Pinterest board for that, and you land on that Pinterest board.

你在谷歌上输入一些东西，订单就可以进入Pinterest董事会，然后你就登陆了Pinterest董事会。

That's how they  acquire new users.

这就是他们获得新用户的方式。

All right.

好的。

I'm going to give some specific tactical advice on some  of these channels.

我将就其中一些渠道提出一些具体的战术建议。

The first one I talked about is referrals and virality.

我谈到的第一个问题是转介和病毒学。

So referrals  is word of mouth.

所以推荐是口碑相传。

If word of mouth is a strong driver of your product,  then referrals is going to be one way that you can amplify that word of  mouth.

如果口碑是你产品的强大推动力，那么推荐将是你放大口碑的一种方式。

How do I define referrals? Financial incentive to tell your friends about the product.

如何定义推荐？财务激励，告诉你的朋友关于产品。

 That's my definition.

这就是我的定义。

This is the Airbnb referral product.

这是Airbnb推荐产品。

You give someone $40 to sign  up to Airbnb, and when they do, I get $20.

你给某人40美元让他注册Airbnb，当他们注册的时候，我得到20美元。

Pretty simple concept.

非常简单的概念。

We had  that on the website and on the mobile app.

我们在网站和移动应用程序上都有。

Now, that's actually more complicated than  you might think.

现在，这实际上比你想象的要复杂得多。

This entire product funnel where there's multiple steps in that funnel, I'm  not going to go into details here, but if you think of a referrals product  is not just as simple as throwing that offer out.

在这个漏斗中有多个步骤的整个产品漏斗，我不打算在这里详细介绍，但如果你想到一个推荐产品，就不只是简单地扔掉那个报价了。

That's probably what you want  to do in the very beginning, but once you have referral power, you want to  start measuring each of these steps.

这可能是你一开始就想要做的事情，但一旦你有了推荐权，你就想开始衡量这些步骤中的每一个。

Like what is that referral offer? How many people  go to that page? How many people send invites? How many of those invites are  being clicked on? How many of those people sign up from those invites? How many  of those people are signed up and are booking? Each one of those steps is  a step in this funnel.

比如那个引荐提议是什么？有多少人会去那个页面？有多少人发出邀请？这些邀请中有多少是被点击的？这些人中有多少人是从这些邀请中注册的？这些人中有多少人已经注册并正在预订？这些步骤中的每一步都是这个漏斗中的一步。

Let's talk about one specific step, the referrals email invite.

让我们谈谈一个具体的步骤，推荐电子邮件邀请。

 So we would spend a lot of time optimizing this step because there were lots  of people getting their referrals email invite at Airbnb.

所以我们会花很多时间优化这个步骤，因为有很多人在Airbnb上收到了他们的推荐电子邮件邀请。

So what are the things you  can optimize on a referral invite email? First, who's the sender of the email? If  it's just Airbnb, I probably never heard of Airbnb for the first time I get  this email.

那么，在推荐邀请电子邮件中，您可以优化哪些内容？首先，谁是电子邮件的发送者？如果只是Airbnb，我可能第一次收到这封电子邮件时从未听说过Airbnb。

If it's Gustaf that sent the email, and I send it to my  friends, they have heard of me.

如果是古斯塔夫发送了这封电子邮件，我把它发送给我的朋友，他们已经听说过我。

That's the reason to open the email.

这就是打开电子邮件的原因。

So people  open the email.

所以人们打开电子邮件。

Clear value.

清除值。

What is this email about? Many emails you start with  text.

这封电子邮件是关于什么的？很多电子邮件都是以文本开头的。

Don't start with text.

不要从文本开始。

Just have the clear value prop at the top.

只需在顶部有明确的价值道具。

Why  should I care about this email? In this case, it's extremely simple.

我为什么要关心这封电子邮件？在这种情况下，它非常简单。

Gustaf sent you  $40 for your first trip.

古斯塔夫寄给你40美元作为你第一次旅行的费用。

That sounds good.

听起来不错。

What is that about? I'm going to  read about it.

这是怎么回事？我要去读关于它的书。

When do I have to care about this? By this date.

我什么时候要关心这个？到今天为止。

In  the next month.

下个月。

So I can't just leave this email and never open it again.

所以我不能只留下这封电子邮件，然后再也不打开它。

 I have to do it right now.

我必须现在就做。

What do I have to do here? Well,  I could sign up, which is an undefined thing that you can do sometime in  the future, or I can do what we did here was accept my invitation.

我在这里要做什么？嗯，我可以注册，这是一件不确定的事情，你可以在将来的某个时候做，或者我可以做我们在这里做的事情就是接受我的邀请。

That  sounds more exclusive.

听起来更有排他性。

That sounds like something that is just for me.

这听起来像是只适合我的东西。

It doesn't sound  like something I can do anything in the future.

这听起来不像是我将来什么都能做的事情。

And finally, here's some social proof  from this email.

最后，这里有一些来自这封电子邮件的社会证据。

This is me.

这就是我。

I live in San Francisco.

我住在旧金山。

We can reveal that.

我们可以揭露这一点。

 I've actually been a member of Airbnb since 2009, and we can reveal that as  well.

实际上，我从2009年起就是Airbnb的成员，我们也可以透露这一点。

Let's talk about pay growth.

让我们谈谈工资增长。

Each of these sections, referrals, pay growth, SEO, can  be a presentation on its own.

这些部分中的每一个，引荐，薪酬增长，SEO，都可以是自己的演示文稿。

So it's impossible for me to go into deep  details on this, but if you're determined that you have product-market fit, you want to  go on these channels and this is the channel you want to go deep on,  you're going to have to go really deep on it because being really good at  one of these channels requires a lot of work.

所以我不可能深入到这个问题上，但是如果你确定你有产品-市场匹配，你想去这些渠道，这就是你想深入的渠道，你必须非常深入，因为真正擅长这些渠道之一需要很多的工作。(这就是你想要深入的渠道。

So there's lots and lots of  stuff online about how to get really good at one of these channels.

所以网上有很多关于如何真正擅长这些渠道的东西。

It doesn't  really make sense to get good at all of them because most of you won't  really need all of them.

对所有这些都做得很好是没有意义的，因为你们中的大多数人不会真的需要所有的东西。

The number one lesson in paid growth, i.e.

带薪增长的第一课，即

Online marketing,  is to not do it unless you have revenue.

网络营销，就是不做，除非你有收入。

This is the most common mistake  that founders make is they somehow start buying ads for products, and they'll never be  able to pay them back.

这是创始人最常犯的错误，就是他们不知何故开始购买产品的广告，并且永远无法偿还。

Don't do that.

别干那事。

The next thing you want to figure  out is what's called CAC, customer acquisition cost.

你想知道的下一件事就是所谓的CAC，即客户获取成本(Customer Acquisition Cost)。

How much does it cost to acquire  a new paying or new valuable customer? If someone's giving you value back.

获得一个新的付费或有价值的新客户需要多少成本？如果有人把你的价值还给你。

Many of  the advertising tools like Google and Facebook have a very clear system for how they  calculate this, and once you start running ads, they'll start telling you what the cost  is going to be.

许多像Google和Facebook这样的广告工具都有一个非常清晰的计算系统，一旦你开始运行广告，他们就会开始告诉你成本是多少。

Next is going to be that your revenue, projected revenue from  this user, is going to have to be higher than the CAC, higher than the  cost.

接下来是你的收入，这个用户的预计收入，必须高于CAC，高于成本。

Very simple.

非常简单。

Otherwise you can't do this.

否则你不能这么做。

So how do you know? This is  the common question you get early on in paid marketing.

你怎么知道的？这是你在付费营销早期遇到的常见问题。

Well, it seems like in  eight months, it will be higher, but not in the first month.

嗯，看起来八个月后，它会更高，但不是在第一个月。

Well, you can't  take all your money and spend on something that you have no clear certainty of  is going to happen in the future.

嗯，你不能把所有的钱都花在你不确定将来会发生的事情上。

So you're going to have to either wait  eight months, or you're going to look for early indicators that your hypothesis about the  value is going to be stronger.

所以你要么要等八个月，要么你要寻找早期的指标，你关于价值的假设将会更强。

The best thing a startup can do is don't  wait eight months.

创业公司能做的最好的事情就是不要等八个月。

You just have a much lower...

你只是有一个更低的.。

Like a much lower target on  what your CAC is going to be.

就像你的CAC的目标要低得多。

Maybe one month, two months, three months, first  transaction, something like that.

可能一个月，两个月，三个月，第一笔交易，诸如此类。

That's a much better way to do it.

这是一种更好的方式。

The main channels  for online marketing these days is going to be Google, Facebook-Instagram.

如今在线营销的主要渠道将是谷歌，Facebook-Instagram。

That's pretty much it.

差不多就是这样。

 Let's talk about search engine optimization.

让我们谈谈搜索引擎优化。

This has changed a lot in the last couple  of years.

这在过去的几年里发生了很大的变化。

It's very competitive.

竞争很激烈。

And what changed is there used to be millions of  websites that each would rank for tens of millions of keywords.

而改变的是过去有数百万个网站，每个网站都有数千万个关键词。

Now what we have  changed is that the really big companies started getting really good at ranking for all  those keywords.

现在我们改变的是，真正的大公司开始真正擅长于对所有这些关键字进行排名。

So a Pinterest or a TripAdvisor might rank for every single travel keyword  that you can imagine.

因此，Pinterest或TripAdvisor可能会对您可以想象到的每个旅行关键字进行排名。

That's hard for small companies.

这对小公司来说很难。

What that means is that if  you're going to rely on search engine optimization to grow, you're going to have to  be as good as a Pinterest or a TripAdvisor.

这意味着，如果你要依靠搜索引擎优化来成长，你必须像Pinterest或TripAdvisor一样优秀。

Eventually.

终有一天。

Not right away, but eventually.

不是马上，但最终。

 Because it's so competitive to win in this like large world of SEO.

因为在这个庞大的SEO世界中获胜是非常有竞争力的。

When you  get started, you can think of this way.

当你开始的时候，你可以这样想。

SEO is zero sum game.

SEO是零和游戏。

Basically you're  competing against others, so what you do in SEO is going to be a matter  of would you compare to others.

基本上你是在和别人竞争，所以你在SEO中做什么将是一个你会和别人比较的问题。

The second thing is that the keywords that people  search for are changing constantly.

第二，人们搜索的关键词在不断变化。

So if you're building something new, let's say ASMR, I  think, was a thing that came up recently.

所以，如果你正在建造新的东西，比如说ASMR，我认为，是最近才出现的东西。

Lots of companies are able to rank  for that because this is a new keyword.

许多公司能够排名，因为这是一个新的关键字。

There weren't websites built 10 years ago  that ranked for that because the thing didn't really exist.

10年前建立的网站没有排名，因为这个东西实际上并不存在。

All right.

好的。

Let's talk about  SEO, how it works on the technology side.

让我们谈谈SEO，它是如何在技术方面工作的。

This is the Airbnb search results page.

这是Airbnb搜索结果页面。

 This is what you and me see when we go to Airbnb.

这是我们去Airbnb时看到的。

This is what  Google see.

这就是谷歌看到的。

Google just see text.

谷歌只看到文本。

So to be good at SEO, you need to  understand what text am I showing to Google so Google can understand what the website  is about.

所以，要在SEO很好，你需要了解我是什么文本显示给谷歌，以便谷歌可以了解网站是关于什么。

Google can't understand what your site is about, it's not going to rank  it.

谷歌不能理解你的网站是关于什么的，它不会对它进行排名。

What are the two main levers for SEO? The first one is going to  be things I do on my page.

SEO的两个主要杠杆是什么？第一个是我在我的页面上做的事情。

So for example, what's the title of the  page? Can Google read the page? Does the page throw errors? What specific page in  my, keyword am I trying to rank my page for? Well, start with the keywords,  do some research and see what are people searching for.

例如，页面的标题是什么？谷歌能读懂这个页面吗？页面是否抛出错误？在我的关键字中，我尝试为我的页面排名的具体页面是什么？那么，从关键词开始，做一些研究，看看人们在搜索什么。

How many people are searching  for ASMR in the United States per month? Maybe I want to try to rank  for that keyword.

每月有多少人在美国搜索ASMR？也许我想尝试排名该关键字。

Well, Build a Website is trying to rank for that keyword.

那么，建立一个网站是试图排名的关键字。

Start  with Google.

从谷歌开始。

Don't start with your own content.

不要从你自己的内容开始。

You don't know exactly what people are  searching for, so you're going to start doing some research.

你并不确切地知道人们在搜索什么，所以你要开始做一些研究。

The second thing is the  thing you can't do that much about which is called off page optimization or domain  authority or something like that, which basically means how valuable does Google perceive your website  to be in the grand scheme of all websites.

第二件事是你不能做那么多的事情，这被称为关闭页面优化或域权威或类似的东西，这基本上意味着谷歌认为你的网站在所有网站的宏伟计划中有多有价值。

And the more inbound links you  get from press, the more links you get from all kinds of people that also  have high authority, the more valuable your website will be in the eyes of Google,  which means it will rank you higher on some of the keywords you're trying to  rank for because it will compare you to other websites and see if they seem  more or less authoritative.

而且你从媒体获得的入站链接越多，你从各种具有高权威的人那里得到的链接就越多，你的网站在谷歌的眼中就会越有价值，这意味着它会在你试图排名的一些关键字上给你排名更高，因为它会将你与其他网站进行比较，看看它们看起来是更权威还是更不权威。

I'm going into details here.

我将在这里详细介绍。

A lot is basically high Google  work.

很多基本上都是高谷歌的工作。

If you're curious about this, you can Google page rank and go to the  Wikipedia article on page rank.

如果你对此很好奇，你可以谷歌页面排名，然后转到维基百科的页面排名文章。

Basically it will explain sort of like high level how  Google works.

基本上，它将解释像谷歌如何高水平的工作。

Final section, I'm going to go through this one a little faster.

最后一节，我会更快地讲完这一节。

Most  of you guys don't have to focus on A/B testing at all.

你们大多数人根本不需要关注A/B测试。

It won't matter  for a long time.

这在很长一段时间内都无关紧要。

It is a great decision making tool later on.

这是一个很好的决策工具。

Here's the  situation that startups tend to get into.

这是初创公司往往会陷入的情况。

I want to launch a new home page.

我想启动一个新的主页。

 I want to launch a new design.

我想推出一个新的设计。

I did, and the numbers went down.

我做了，数字下降了。

What  happened? It's a really hard problem to launch something new and then sort of just  look at the metric over time.

怎么回事？这是一个非常困难的问题，要发布一些新的东西，然后看看一段时间后的度量标准。

Don't do that.

别干那事。

There's a better way.

有更好的办法。

First, before  you get into that stage, you want to figure out is A/B testing something I  want to do? The best way to do that is to go to Google and  type in A/B testing calculator.

首先，在你进入那个阶段之前，你想弄清楚A/B测试是不是我想做的事情？最好的方法是去谷歌输入A/B测试计算器。

Think of the metrics that you're trying to change here.

想一想你试图在这里改变的指标。

 So like visitors to some conversion metric.

所以就像访问者使用某种转换度量。

Put them into the first link you see  on Google, and they'll tell you whether it's going to be worth doing.

把它们放入你在Google上看到的第一个链接，他们会告诉你是否值得这么做。

Mostly it  won't be worth doing for quite a while.

大多数情况下，在相当长的一段时间内，它都不值得去做。

So here's the example I'm trying to  give you on the website.

这是我试图在网站上给你的例子。

So I want to ship a new experience, our new  design on the home page.

所以我想在主页上发布一种新的体验，我们的新设计。

So let's ship it.

所以让我们发货吧。

The metric went up.

公制上涨了。

Or the  metric went down.

或者指标下降了。

Either way, like I don't know if the website actually caused it  or not.

无论是哪种方式，就像我不知道网站是否真的导致了它。

The only way for me to know if this new design actually changed  the metric is if I had an alternative site of history.

唯一让我知道这个新设计是否真的改变了度量的方法就是我是否有一个替代的历史站点。

Think of two different  parallel universes at the same time, one with a new design and one with the  old design.

同时考虑两个不同的平行宇宙，一个是新的设计，一个是旧的设计。

If I had that, I can tell exactly what happened.

如果我有那个，我就能确切地说出发生了什么。

That's the definition  of A/B testing.

这就是A/B测试的定义。

You basically have two different parallel universes of the thing you shipped  at the same time, and you measure the metrics that matter to you.

你基本上有两个不同的平行宇宙的东西，你在同一时间，你衡量的指标，重要的是你。

The reason  this is so powerful, it helps you make decisions at scale.

这之所以如此强大，是因为它可以帮助你做出大规模的决策。

What ends up happening  to founders when they get five or 10 people in the company and they launch  a new design and they're arguing about what caused the thing to go up or  go down, the only way to really know is to run an A/B test to  figure out what does the metric say about why it went up or down.

当创始人有5个或10个人加入公司，他们推出了一个新的设计，他们在争论是什么导致了事情的上升或下降，真正知道的唯一方法就是运行A/B测试，以找出指标说明了它为什么上升或下降的原因时，最终会发生什么事情。

This  is hard to internalize because most people think of themself as good product thinkers.

这很难内化，因为大多数人认为自己是优秀的产品思想家。

So  I want to talk about one thing called experimental view.

所以我想谈谈一种叫做实验观点的东西。

This is at Airbnb.

这是在Airbnb。

How  many here think that you guys have good product instincts? Raise your hand.

这里有多少人认为你们有很好的产品直觉？举起你的手。

You guys  are founders.

你们是创始人。

You should have good product instincts.

你应该有良好的产品直觉。

All right, let's see how good they  are.

好吧，让我们看看他们有多好。

All right.

好的。

I'm going to give you two examples.

我将给你们举两个例子。

So at Airbnb, we launched  a new sharing sheet for the mobile app, and this was the old version which  was the native share sheet that you've seen on iOS.

所以在Airbnb上，我们为移动应用程序发布了一个新的共享表单，这是旧版本，也就是你在iOS上看到的原生共享表单。

You click on share and  then you see a bunch of sharing options.

你点击共享，然后你会看到一堆共享选项。

And then we just tried this new  share sheet that showed more options, called this the experiment, but it didn't really look  native.

然后我们刚刚尝试了这个新的股份表，它显示了更多的选项，称之为实验，但它看起来并不是真正的本土化。

So the question was, which one is better? Well, we didn't really know so  we launched an A/B test.

所以问题是，哪个更好？嗯，我们真的不知道，所以我们启动了A/B测试。

We launched both of them at the same time for  different users.

我们同时为不同的用户推出了这两款产品。

The goal here was to measure number of shares.

这里的目标是测量股票数量。

So all right.

所以好吧。

How  many here think that the control was better? How many people think that this experiment  was better? How many people thought there was no difference? This is quite common.

这里有多少人认为控制更好？有多少人认为这个实验更好？有多少人认为没有区别？这是很常见的。

This  is about 40% better for us.

这对我们来说大约好40%。

So thank God we ran experiments because if this  was the decision making group, then we wouldn't have made the right decision.

所以感谢上帝我们进行了实验，因为如果这是决策小组，那么我们就不会做出正确的决定。

Next one.

下一个。

 Should we have a sign up wall or not in the app? Now these are  not necessarily learnings that you can apply to your companies right away, but it was  an important decision for us to determine.

我们是否应该在应用程序中设置注册墙？现在，这些不一定是你可以马上申请到你的公司的知识，但这是我们需要确定的一个重要决定。

So should we have people just open their  Airbnb app and go straight into the app, or should we have an experiment where  you can click out and X out the sign up wall, or should we have  a sign up wall that is a wall that you can't climb over? You have  to sign up, otherwise you can't use the Airbnb app.

那么，我们是应该让人们打开他们的Airbnb应用程序，直接进入应用程序，还是应该进行一个实验，你可以点击并退出注册墙，或者我们应该有一个注册墙，这是一堵你不能爬过去的墙吗？你必须注册，否则你不能使用Airbnb应用程序。

Which one is better? How  many here think that the control, no sign up wall is better? Raise your hand.

哪一个更好？这里有多少人认为控制，没有注册墙更好？举起你的手。

 How many people thought that the experiment where you can X out and then sign  up was better? How many people thought that just like this wall you can't climb  over was better? That's the fewest amount of people.

有多少人认为可以通过X退出然后注册的实验更好？有多少人认为就像这堵墙你爬不过去更好？这是最少的人。

All right.

好的。

So this was a  little better.

所以这个稍微好一点。

We got 2.6% more bookings from iOS by making people sign up through  a sign up wall in the app.

通过让人们通过应用程序中的注册墙进行注册，我们从iOS获得的预订量增加了2.6%。

Why is that? Well, we knew something about  them so we can show them more personalized stuff.

这是为什么？嗯，我们知道一些关于他们的事情，所以我们可以向他们展示更个性化的东西。

And when they were about to  book, we already had them sign up so didn't have to at the time of  booking go through the motions of signing up.

当他们要预订的时候，我们已经让他们注册了，所以在预订的时候不必经过注册的动作。

You want to learn why it cost  us, the whole point is basically when you get big enough, when you're starting to  grow and you have these decisions about should I launch this thing or not, this  is a really good way to do it.

你想知道为什么它会让我们付出代价，关键是当你变得足够大，当你开始成长时，你会决定我是否应该发射这个东西，这是一个非常好的方式。

Product decisions are really hard, so using  data to make them is a good way.

产品决策真的很难，所以使用数据来做出决策是一种很好的方式。

Most of you won't have to worry  about this for a while, so don't worry about it.

你们大多数人在一段时间内不需要担心这个，所以不用担心。

Here's a summary of my  talk today.

这是我今天演讲的总结。

Most of you need to do things that don't scale.

你们中的大多数人需要做一些不能伸缩的事情。

You are not  at the place where you can think about real growth things the growth teams do.

你不是在你可以思考成长团队所做的真正成长的事情的地方。

 So you have to unlearn the things you've learned at your big companies or MBA  programs, and just do things that don't scale.

因此，你必须忘掉你在大公司或MBA项目中学到的东西，只是做一些不能扩展的事情。

Secondly, you want to measure your retention  to understand if you have product-market fit.

其次，你想衡量你的保留率，以了解你的产品是否适合市场。

There are other ways too, but that's the  best way in my opinion.

还有其他的方法，但在我看来这是最好的方法。

And third, you want to build a culture of experimentation.

第三，你想要建立一种实验文化。

 You want to use data and not have the loudest voice in your room deciding  what the best decision is, but you want to use data and experimentation to decide  what is the best decision.

你想使用数据，而不是让房间里最响亮的声音来决定什么是最好的决定，但你想使用数据和实验来决定什么是最好的决定。

Probably doesn't matter right now, but it will matter at  some point.

也许现在并不重要，但在某个时候它会很重要。

Thank you.

谢谢。

Do we have time for questions? All right.

我们有时间提问吗？好的。

A couple of  questions.

几个问题。

Yes, right there.
Speaker 2:For marketplace data, at which stage do we have to start measuring the product-market fit,  because I think you mentioned that surveys can be biased, but only paid users will  be accurate to measure product-market fit, so at which stage in a startup should we  measure it?
Gustaf...tromer:The question was if I'm a marketplace startup, at what stage should I be measuring  product-market fit? So let's think about what the metrics might be.

是的，就在那里。演讲者2：对于市场数据，我们必须在哪个阶段开始衡量产品与市场的契合度，因为我认为你提到过调查可能会有偏见，但只有付费用户才能准确地衡量产品与市场的契合度，那么我们应该在初创公司的哪个阶段衡量呢？Gustaf.Tromer：问题是如果我是一家市场初创公司，我应该在什么阶段衡量产品与市场的契合度？因此，让我们考虑一下度量标准可能是什么。

The first metric is  probably on one side of the marketplace, the supply, how often are they coming back  or doing the thing that they're doing? And then the other side is demand, how  often are they coming back and doing what they're doing? Hopefully these are not like  Airbnb where it's like once a year on the demand side.

第一个指标可能是市场的一边，供应，他们多久回来一次或做他们正在做的事情？然后另一边是需求，他们回来做他们正在做的事情的频率有多高？希望这些不像Airbnb那样，在需求方面一年只有一次。

It's more frequent than  that.

比那更频繁。

Because then you can measure right away.

因为这样你就可以马上测量。

There's no need to wait.

没必要再等了。

In the  case of Airbnb where supply would happen every month or every couple of weeks, you  certainly want to measure and see if your hosts are sticking around.

在Airbnb的情况下，每个月或每隔几周供应一次，你当然想衡量一下，看看你的主人是否还在附近。

If they're sticking  around, that means they're doing their host bookings repeatedly.

如果他们留在这里，这意味着他们在重复他们的主机预订。

That means there's something good there.

这意味着那里有一些好东西。

 On the demand side, depends on how long you'll take to get the second booking  on the demand side.

在需求端，取决于您在需求端获得第二次预订所需的时间。

But I would measure both of them like pretty early.

但我会很早就测量它们。

Like  if I was an investor and I would meet with an early marketplace startup, I  would want to understand, what is the repeat usage, and I decide.

例如，如果我是一个投资者，我会遇到一个早期的市场初创公司，我会想知道，重复使用是什么，然后我决定。

That's the thing  I really care about.

这才是我真正关心的。

So I would want you to measure right away.

所以我希望你马上测量。

Now that  measurement is not going to solve the doing things that don't scale.

现在，这种测量不会解决不能伸缩的事情。

So this is  like a thing you do in the background while you're doing all the things that  don't scale.

所以这就像你在后台做的事情，而你正在做所有不能伸缩的事情。

Yes?
Speaker 3:Quick question.

是?演讲者3：快速提问。

Local search on engine optimization vs.

引擎优化的本地搜索与

National, what are the key differences? If  focus is very much on the local, what should we care about more compared to  national?
Gustaf...tromer:So the question is, what matters more for local search? Our work can't tell exactly  what matters.

国家，主要区别是什么？如果焦点非常集中在本地，那么与国家相比，我们应该更关心什么呢？古斯塔夫.特洛默：所以问题是，什么对本地搜索更重要？我们的工作不能确切地说明什么才是重要的。

The Google algorithm is a black box, so it's hard to say.

谷歌算法是一个黑匣子，所以很难说。

The  most important thing that I would say that matters to Google is to really think  about what intentions does the searcher have when they put something into Google.

最重要的事情，我要说的是，对谷歌重要的是真正考虑搜索者在将某些内容放入谷歌时的意图。

So if  look for apartments, apartments in San Francisco, what can I be meaning? I could be  meaning renting apartments long term.

所以，如果寻找公寓，旧金山的公寓，我能有什么意义呢？我的意思可能是长期租房。

I could be meaning short-term rentals.

我可能是指短期租赁。

I could be meaning  a lot of different things around apartments.

我可能在公寓周围有很多不同的意思。

I could be meaning like the concept of  apartments.

我的意思可能是公寓的概念。

The more you understand of the intention of the people that are typing in  specific keywords...

你越了解那些键入特定关键字的人的意图…

Say if I type in coffee shops on Mission Street, that's probably a  high intention that they want to go to a coffee shop on Mission Street.

比方说，如果我在任务街上的咖啡店打字，这可能是他们想去任务街上的咖啡店的一个很高的意图。

So  I think that's the first thing you want to really figure out, is like what  keywords have that high intention for the things that I offer.
Speaker 3:Like in local cultures, or local activities and things-
Gustaf...tromer:Yeah.

所以我认为这是你想要真正弄明白的第一件事，就像什么关键字对我提供的东西有那么高的意图。演讲者3：就像在当地的文化，或当地的活动和事情-古斯塔夫.特洛默：是的。

So local activity is like, if someone says like, "What are fun things to  do in [inaudible]?" Or, "What are the art shows in Oakland?" Like that was a  clearly...

所以当地的活动就像，如果有人说，“在[听不见]里有什么有趣的事情可以做？”或者，“奥克兰有什么艺术展？”就像那是一个明显的.。

People that live in those cities that this is going to be most relevant  for, and you want to rank for all of it because you're not going to  sit in Florida and type in those two things.

生活在那些城市的人们，这将是最相关的，你想要排名所有，因为你不会坐在佛罗里达，输入这两个东西。

Most likely.

很有可能。

So I would just  try to understand what are the keywords that matter to you, and what is the  intention behind those keywords.
Speaker 4:On the topic of marketplaces, if my users are buying at different rates, some users  are buying once a week, some users once a month, once every few months...

所以我会试着理解对你来说重要的关键字是什么，以及这些关键字背后的意图是什么。演讲者4：关于市场的话题，如果我的用户以不同的价格购买，有些用户每周购买一次，有些用户每月一次，每几个月一次…

Just  to give you an example, I run a website that connects graphic designers to creative  entrepreneurs for artwork, and some people need that once a week, once a month like  I said.

只是给你一个例子，我运行一个网站，连接平面设计师和创意企业家的艺术作品，有些人需要每周一次，每月一次，就像我说的那样。

How do I measure, for user retention, how do I measure that for  product-market fit when everyone's kind of buying at different rates?
Gustaf...tromer:So the question was, for a marketplace for people buying graphic design, how do I  measure the product-market fit on each side if people have different sort of like cycles  through which when they buy that? Well, first I would try and figure out who  are those different people that have these different cycles.

我如何衡量，为了留住用户，当每个人都以不同的价格购买时，我如何衡量产品-市场契合度？古斯塔夫…特洛默：所以问题是，对于一个购买平面设计的市场，如果人们在购买时有不同的相似周期，我如何衡量产品-市场在每一方的适合性？嗯，首先我会试着弄清楚那些有不同周期的不同的人是谁。

Like are they different kinds of  companies? Is there one group I'd rather focus on than the other? If I were  Lyft, I'd rather focus on people that travel daily than people that travel yearly, so  that makes more sense for me to spend time on trying to acquire more of  those people.

比如他们是不同类型的公司吗？有没有一个群体我更愿意关注而不是另一个群体？如果我是Lyft，我宁愿关注每天出差的人，而不是每年出差的人，所以对我来说，花时间尝试获得更多这些人更有意义。

So in your case, I would try to figure out what's the intersection  between the most valuable people that are the most frequent.

所以在你的情况下，我会试着找出最有价值的人和最频繁的人之间的交叉点是什么。

It's rare that you'll have  massive differences in retention and they're both love your product, if that makes sense.

很少有你会有巨大的差异，保持和他们都喜欢你的产品，如果这是有意义的。

It's  very rare that you have people use Uber once a year, and then you have  lots of people use it every day, and somehow that you should be focusing on  both.

很少有人一年使用Uber一次，然后每天都有很多人在使用Uber，不知何故，你应该把注意力放在两者上。

If you have people using it once a year, if you are Uber, your  goal will be to get them to use you more often.

如果你有人一年使用一次，如果你是Uber，你的目标将是让他们更频繁地使用你。

So I would try  to think of like, what is the ideal use case that how often they will  be using what I'm doing, how often do you start up a new graphic design,  and if they only need it once a year, you've probably not gotten the product  to a point where you thought of all the use cases they would need for  graphic design.

所以我会试着想想，什么是理想的用例，他们使用我正在做的东西的频率，你多久启动一次新的图形设计，如果他们一年只需要一次，你可能还没有把产品弄到你想到他们需要的所有用例来进行图形设计的地步。

There are probably a lot of other things, everything from like logos, to  website design, to landing pages, to stickers, to like gazillion things.

可能还有很多其他的东西，从像徽标，到网站设计，到登陆页面，到贴纸，再到喜欢的无数东西。

Like if they're more  of these things that you can incorporate into your offering, probably you'll get that more-frequent  use case.

例如，如果它们更多的是您可以整合到您的产品中的这些东西，那么您可能会得到更频繁的用例。

But I would measure both on the supply side, the designers, how many  jobs are they taking on the marketplace? Are they stopping to take jobs? If so,  why? This is typically in the early days a great source of ideas for a  roadmap.

但我会从供应方和设计师两方面衡量，他们在市场上承担了多少工作？他们会停下来接受工作吗？若然，原因何在？这通常在早期是路线图的一个很好的想法来源。

Why do people stop using my product? Talk to them.

为什么人们停止使用我的产品？和他们谈谈。

Call them.

打电话给他们。

Email them.

给他们发邮件。

 Do anything you can to understand why someone stopped using your product because that's the  things you have to fix.

尽你所能理解为什么有人停止使用你的产品，因为这是你必须修复的事情。

Yes?
Speaker 5:I'm curious of this double for Airbnb, especially because like a new theme for Air  Bed and Breakfast, it was like a hotel you could depend on.

是?演讲者5：我对Airbnb的这个双人间很好奇，特别是因为就像空气床和早餐的新主题一样，它就像一个你可以依赖的酒店。

How was the  difference between experience of people, some who try Airbnb and is like, "Oh, Air Bed  and Breakfast is not a thing for me," vs., "Oh, this specific host is not  a thing for me," because the variance might be very, very high.

一些尝试Airbnb的人的体验之间的区别是，“哦，空气床和早餐对我来说不是一件事，”与“哦，这个特定的主人对我来说不是一件事”，因为差异可能非常，非常大。

How [inaudible]-
Gustaf...tromer:So the question was, if the quality or the variance of a product, early days,  is very different for different people, like how is that for Airbnb?
Speaker 5:For different sellers because you have the good sellers in Airbnb, right?
Gustaf...tromer:Yes.
Speaker 5:So what would be...

How[inaudible]-Gustaf.Tromer：所以问题是，如果一个产品的质量或变化，早期，对于不同的人来说是非常不同的，比如Airbnb如何？演讲者5：针对不同的卖家，因为你在Airbnb有畅销书，对吗？古斯塔夫.特洛默：是的。演讲者5：那会是什么.

Give a quite different experience?
Gustaf...tromer:So the question was, how do you deal with the fact the hosts give different  quality experiences, or different experiences? Well, in a marketplace, you want to make sure you  deliver consistent experience.

给人一种完全不同的体验？古斯塔夫·特洛默：所以问题是，你如何处理主持人提供不同质量体验或不同体验的事实？嗯，在市场中，您希望确保提供一致的体验。

So the best way to do that is to do some kind  of reputation system.

所以最好的方法就是建立某种声誉系统。

So Airbnb, one of the best decisions early on is to have  the money, the payments, go through the platform, and once you've paid, you're allowed to  give a review, but only then.

所以Airbnb，早期最好的决定之一就是有钱，有付款，通过平台，一旦你支付了，你就可以给出评论，但只有在那时。

It's only people that stayed with someone and paid  can give a review.

只有和某人呆在一起并付钱的人才能给出评论。

Once you have that review, you can start weeding out bad  hosts and promote the good ones.

一旦你有了这样的评论，你就可以开始淘汰坏的主人，提升好的主人。

That is the best way that I can give  you that will deliver consistency of experience.

这是最好的方式，我可以给你，将提供一致性的经验。

Now a new host, how do you know  if it's going to be consistent? You don't really know.

现在有了新的主机，你怎么知道它会不会是一致的？你不是真的知道。

So a new driver on  Uber, you don't really know.

所以优步的新司机，你并不是真的知道。

You have to do the best that you can to  onboard them.

你必须尽你所能登上他们。

Two more questions.

还有两个问题。

In the very back.
Speaker 6:I just want to [inaudible] something that you said that will test this.

在最后面。演讲者6：我只是想[听不见]你说的一些话来测试这一点。

As far  as you saying that, "Hey, your product is not great.

至于你说的，“嘿，你的产品不是很好。

Someone is just going to  go somewhere else." Right? And kind of saying that, hey, get something out there really  quick.

有人只是想去别的地方。“对吧？有点像是说，嘿，快点弄点东西出来。”

So for example, I have a product that when you log in, it looks  pretty mature.

例如，我有一个产品，当你登录时，它看起来非常成熟。

I can charge for it, right? And I'm kind of balancing like, do  I really want to be nit picky about this because I don't want to charge  for it right off the bat, or just put it up-
Gustaf...tromer:So the question is, I have this product.

我可以收费，对吧？我在平衡，我真的想在这个问题上挑剔吗，因为我不想马上收费，或者只是把它放上去-古斯塔夫.特洛默：所以问题是，我有这个产品。

I could charge for it right away,  but I'm not sure if I want to do that because then it might turn  away more people.

我可以立即收费，但我不确定我是否想这样做，因为那样可能会拒绝更多人。

I would say the true...

我会说真实的.。

You should probably charge for your product  right away, because otherwise you're going to build for people who prefer the free version,  and you're going to build the features that the people that prefer the free version  would want which isn't necessarily the people that value the product.

你可能应该立即为你的产品收费，因为否则你将为喜欢免费版本的人构建，你将构建喜欢免费版本的人想要的功能，而不一定是那些重视产品的人。

So a good example  here might be, if I build something that can both work for consumers and companies,  should I charge of it? Well, consumers are going to be much less likely to  pay for it than companies.

因此，这里的一个很好的例子可能是，如果我构建的东西既适用于消费者，也适用于公司，我是否应该负责它？嗯，与公司相比，消费者支付费用的可能性要小得多。

So companies are the more valuable ones, so you should  focus on the features they want to build for the more valuable customers.

所以公司是更有价值的公司，所以你应该把重点放在他们想要为更有价值的客户构建的功能上。

So I  would argue you should probably charge right away, and if you don't charge for it,  it's kind of like asking your friend, "What do you think about this product?" "Oh,  it's great."
Speaker 6:Well, my question was more along the lines of I'm going to charge right away.

所以我认为你应该马上收费，如果你不收费，这就像是问你的朋友，“你觉得这个产品怎么样？”“哦，太棒了。”演讲者6：嗯，我的问题更像是我要马上充电。

 Do I just put it out there as is, or do I continue like ridiculously  testing to make sure that somebody signs up and they stay?
Gustaf...tromer:Oh.

我是按原样把它放在那里，还是继续进行荒谬的测试，以确保有人签约并留下来？哦。

So the question was, should I charge for it right away? You are going  to charge for it right away.
Speaker 6:But it's just a matter of I can launch today, or I can launch it  like two weeks from now and it's a lot more refined so that the people  that signed up are more likely to stay.
Gustaf...tromer:So the question is that when should I launch basically, because I have more ideas  of things I want to work on this? Most people charge too late...

所以问题是，我应该马上收费吗？你要马上收费。演讲者6：但这只是我今天可以发布的问题，或者我可以在两周后发布它，它更加精致，所以签约的人更有可能留下来。古斯塔夫.特洛默：所以问题是我应该什么时候发布，因为我对我想要在这方面工作的东西有更多的想法？大多数人收费太晚.。

Launch too  late and not too early.

推出得太晚而不是太早。

And if you launch too early, like Kat said, you  have many, many opportunities to launch again.

如果你太早发射，就像Kat说的，你有很多机会再次发射。

The launch is not this big dramatic moment  where you get judged by the entire world, and if they say, "No," then they'll  never come back again.
Speaker 7:I think, I've never seen a company die from losing customers in the first two  weeks.
Gustaf...tromer:I've never seen company die, they're losing customers in the first two weeks.

发射并不是一个巨大的戏剧性时刻，你会受到整个世界的评判，如果他们说“不”，那么他们就再也不会回来了。演讲者7：我认为，我从未见过一家公司在头两周内因失去客户而死亡。古斯塔夫…特洛默：我从未见过公司倒闭，他们在头两个星期就失去了客户。

Basically, you  should launch right away.

基本上，你应该马上启动。

That's the answer.

这就是答案。

And if it doesn't work, launch again.

如果不起作用，再发射一次。

Last  question.

最后一个问题。

Right there.
Speaker 8:I'm part of a company.

就在那儿。演讲者8：我是一家公司的一部分。

We have a platform campaign so we're essentially taking pre-orders.

我们有一个平台宣传活动，所以我们基本上是在接受预订。

 We can't optimize for retention yet, so there's no product-market fit, the product isn't shipping  until December, we have about 500 orders right now.

我们还不能优化保留率，所以没有产品适合市场，产品要到12月才发货，我们现在大约有500个订单。

Do I...

我是不是.。

What do you think  about adding like paid acquisitions? Because I am getting enough revenue basically.
Gustaf...tromer:So the question is I have a harder product I haven't launched yet.

你对增加付费收购有什么看法？因为我基本上得到了足够的收入。古斯塔夫…特洛默：所以问题是我有一个更难的产品，我还没有推出。

I'm doing  Kickstarter, so I can't measure product-market fit.

我在做Kickstarter，所以我无法衡量产品与市场的契合度。

You don't have to worry about product-market fit  at all because it doesn't matter.

你根本不必担心产品与市场的契合度，因为这并不重要。

You don't really know if people are going to  use your product yet because you haven't built it.

你还不知道人们是否会使用你的产品，因为你还没有构建它。

So that's the truth here.

所以这就是事实。

Your  goal is to launch it, but because it's more expensive than just a website, you're  going to need a lot more money to launch it.

你的目标是推出它，但因为它比一个网站更昂贵，你需要更多的钱来推出它。

As long as the CAC  trail that we work out, that you are paying some money to acquire people through  Kickstarter and you get more money back from those people, you could do paid.

只要我们制定的CAC路线，你支付一些钱通过Kickstarter获得人们，并且你从这些人那里得到更多的钱，你就可以付钱。

You're  going to have to be very good at understanding those two things, measuring the difference  between the CAC and LTV, and I don't know to what extent Kickstarter provide the  tools for you to measure specifically the people that came in through your ads and  the ability to measure the return on investment for those people.

你必须非常好地理解这两件事，衡量CAC和LTV之间的差异，我不知道Kickstarter在多大程度上为你提供了工具，让你具体衡量通过你的广告进来的人，以及衡量这些人的投资回报的能力。

But that's the thing  you really need to figure out.

但这才是你真正需要弄明白的。

I think it could be fine if you know  what you're doing.

我想如果你知道自己在做什么就可以了。

I think it's risky to spend money on...

我认为把钱花在…上是有风险的。

Boosting a Kickstarter product.

提升Kickstarter产品。

 I think what I've seen on most of the successful ones, what they do is  to try to get their friends early on in the product, in that launch, so  that it has momentum right away, and the momentum itself will carry on the Kickstarter  campaign.

我认为我在大多数成功的公司身上看到的，他们所做的就是试图让他们的朋友在产品的早期，在发布中，这样它马上就有了动力，而动力本身将会继续Kickstarter的营销活动。

That's what I've seen.

这就是我所看到的。

All right.

好的。

Thank you very much.


非常感谢。
