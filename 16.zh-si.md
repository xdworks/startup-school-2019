#  Kevin Hale - How to Evaluate Startup Ideas Pt.2


Kevin Hale:This is going to be part two of a talk I gave at the very  beginning of Startup School on evaluating startup ideas.

凯文·黑尔：这将是我在创业学校刚开始时所做的关于评估创业想法的演讲的第二部分。

The thing to know about both of  these talks is we've been talking about them from the point of view of the  investor.

关于这两个谈话，需要知道的是我们一直从投资者的角度讨论它们。

Basically, it was helpful, I thought, to explain to founders how investors evaluate startup  ideas and looking at that structure so that they can better understand their own ideas,  opportunities, and then in this presentation, present them better to the people that they want  to get excited.

基本上，我认为，向创始人解释投资者如何评估初创公司的想法，以及如何看待这种结构，以便他们更好地理解自己的想法和机会，然后在这个演示中，更好地向他们想要兴奋的人展示这些想法和机会，是有帮助的。

A quick recap, in the first part I basically say a startup  idea is a hypothesis for why your company is going to grow really quickly.

简单回顾一下，在第一部分，我基本上说创业理念是关于为什么你的公司会快速发展的一个假设。

That  hypothesis must compose of three different parts; the problem, the solution and the insight.

这个假设必须由三个不同的部分组成：问题，解决方案和洞察力。

The  basic parts is your problem should be pretty big, pretty pervasive, have a lot of  these characteristics to make it feel like there's a very big market that a lot  of people have the problem.

最基本的部分是你的问题应该非常大，非常普遍，有很多这样的特征，让人感觉有一个非常大的市场，很多人都有这个问题。

The only thing you need to know about the solution  is that you should not start with the technology.

关于解决方案，您需要知道的唯一件事就是您不应该从技术开始。

You should start with a problem.

你应该从一个问题开始。

 Lastly, you're looking to have something that's going to make your company unique and have  some kind of unfair advantage that we call an insight that will show why your  company will grow faster than other companies.

最后，你希望有一些东西能让你的公司独一无二，并具有某种不公平的优势，我们称之为洞察力，它将显示为什么你的公司会比其他公司增长得更快。

I talked about five different types of unfair  advantages that your company can have and what are the benchmarks for meeting them.

我谈到了贵公司可能拥有的五种不同类型的不公平优势，以及达到这些优势的基准是什么。

The  thing to keep in mind about understanding and creating this startup idea is that I  don't need you to do all the work, to lay all of that out in  detail.

关于理解和创建这个创业想法，需要牢记的是，我不需要你做所有的工作，把所有的细节都列出来。

That's stuff that you'll want to know and keep in mind, but a really  good investor will do that on their own.

这是你想知道并牢记在心的事情，但一个真正好的投资者会自己做这件事。

They'll hear what you're talking about and  extrapolate.

他们会听到你在说什么然后推断出来。

What I'm going to cover in this presentation is how do you package up  that hypothesis? How do you take all the things that you understand about your company  and your startup idea and how do you present it to an investor so that  they can make a decision that's in your favor? This is the YC Startup application,  and basically, this is the application, all the questions that we ask that YC partners  will use to evaluate your startup.

我将在这个演示文稿中介绍的是如何将这个假设打包起来？你如何把你所了解的关于你的公司和你的创业想法的所有事情，以及你如何将它呈现给投资者，以便他们做出对你有利的决定呢？这是YC Startup应用程序，基本上，这就是应用程序，我们提出的所有问题，YC合作伙伴将使用这些问题来评估您的启动。

Down here when you're filling out the YC application,  we actually link to a couple of things, and one of them is how to  apply successfully.

在这里，当你填写YC申请时，我们实际上链接到几件事情，其中之一是如何成功申请。

I can't tell, because I read so many applications but it feels like  founders are not reading that essay.

我不能说，因为我读了太多的申请，但感觉就像创始人没有读那篇文章一样。

It was written by Paul Graham in 2009 and  almost everything in there still holds to this day, and people still make mistakes on  it.

它是保罗·格雷厄姆在2009年写的，几乎所有的东西到今天仍然有效，人们仍然在它上面犯错误。

I'm just going to point out some stuff and really punch it in here  while I have your attention.

我只是想指出一些东西，在我引起你注意的时候真的在这里敲打它。

Here's a quote from that essay.

这是从那篇文章中引用的一句话。

"Basically, we believe for  every company that we will interview at YC, we bet there's probably another company that's  just as good as them out there, but they messed up on the application and  we didn't realize it.

“基本上，我们相信我们将在YC面试的每一家公司，我们打赌可能还有另一家公司和他们一样好，但他们在申请上搞砸了，我们没有意识到这一点。

We didn't invite them." Basically, the reason is because they didn't  express their idea clearly.

我们没有邀请他们“，基本上是因为他们没有把自己的想法表达清楚。

That's it.

就这样。

You might think, "Oh, I didn't show off all  that complex stuff about my startup idea and that's why they didn't pick me." I  want you to know that's not true.

你可能会想，“哦，我没有炫耀关于我的创业想法的所有复杂的东西，这就是为什么他们没有选择我。”我想让你知道这不是真的。

The first thing I want you to keep  in mind is I do not need you to sell me as a YC partner.

我想让你记住的第一件事是，我不需要你把我作为YC合作伙伴出售。

 A good investor...

一个好的投资者.。

So an average investor, what they do is they talk to you  when you tell them about your idea and it feels like they're poking holes.

所以，一个普通的投资者，他们所做的就是当你告诉他们你的想法时，他们会跟你说话，感觉他们就像是在戳洞。

All  the questions they ask about what's all the reasons why this could go wrong.

他们问的所有问题都是关于为什么会出错的所有原因。

A  good investor does it the other way around.

一个好的投资者会用相反的方式来做这件事。

They hear what you say and they  imagine and they use your optimism and they use knowing that some kind of rare  event has to happen for you to become a billion-dollar company, and they try to  imagine all those rare events that could possibly happen to you.

他们听到你说的，他们想象，他们利用你的乐观主义，他们利用知道你必须发生某种罕见的事件才能成为一家价值数十亿美元的公司，他们试图想象所有那些可能发生在你身上的罕见事件。

Then they pitch that  path back to you.

然后他们就会把这条路扔给你。

We are really good at selling ourselves so you don't need  to do that.

我们真的很擅长推销自己，所以你不需要这样做。

The thing is, you guys are kind of bad at selling things  in the beginning, right? What I need you to understand is that I'm trying to  evaluate these three statements when I'm hearing your idea.

问题是，你们一开始就不太会卖东西，对吧？我需要你理解的是，当我听到你的想法时，我正在试图评估这三个说法。

Do I understand it? Am I  excited by it? Do I like the team and do I want to work with  them? Surprise! In your weekly updates when you do your group sessions these are the  questions that we ask you to ask one another.

我明白了吗？我是不是很兴奋？我喜欢这个团队吗？我想和他们一起工作吗？惊喜！在您的每周更新中，当您进行小组会议时，这些是我们要求您相互提问的问题。

It's basically the questions that we're  trying to figure out for ourselves, and we're hoping that every week when you talk  with other companies, you are practicing getting feedback and understanding whether you're able to instill  this in other people.

这基本上是我们自己试图解决的问题，我们希望每周当你与其他公司交谈时，你都在练习获得反馈，并了解你是否能够将这些灌输给其他人。

Your goal is just to be clear.

你的目标只是想弄清楚。

I will do everything  else.

我会做其他的事。

Back to the application.

回到应用程序。

These are the only two things we're going to focus  on today.

这是我们今天仅关注的两件事。

What do I put in the what's my company going to make? How  do I describe my company in a very efficient manner? The first way to do  this is to be clear.

我该在我的公司要做什么的这一栏里写些什么呢？我如何以非常有效的方式描述我的公司？做到这一点的第一种方法是明确。

The reason we focus on this is because a clear  idea is the foundation for growth.

我们之所以关注这一点，是因为清晰的理念是增长的基础。

What I mean by that is that the best  companies in YC or around the world grow organically.

我的意思是YC或世界各地最好的公司都是有机成长的。

They grow by word of mouth.

他们通过口耳相传的方式成长。

 What does word of mouth look like? It looks like this.

口碑是什么样的？看起来是这样的。

It's basically I talk  about your company, what you're doing, making, et cetera, and I'm the most interesting person  at the dinner table.

基本上我谈论你的公司，你在做什么，等等，我是餐桌上最有趣的人。

I tell it to other people and those people want to  tell other people.

我把它告诉其他人，那些人想告诉其他人。

That's it.

就这样。

Word of mouth is something where I remember what you  do, I talk about it enthusiastic and it spreads on its own.

口碑是我记得你所做的事情，我满怀热情地谈论它，然后它自己传播开来。

Marketing and advertising,  it's a tax, I believe, companies pay because they did not make something remarkable.

市场营销和广告，这是一种税收，我相信，公司支付是因为他们没有创造出非凡的东西。

Now,  before anyone can remember at the dinner table what you do, they have to understand.

现在，在任何人都能记得你在餐桌上做什么之前，他们必须理解。

 I have very simple rules for how to make things easy to understand.

我有一个非常简单的规则，就是如何让事情变得容易理解。

This will  sound familiar if you're familiar with an essay I wrote on how to design a  better pitch deck, and I'm going to focus on basically saying that the way I  talk about designing a pitch deck actually works for ideas and lots of other things.

如果你熟悉我写的一篇关于如何设计一个更好的沥青甲板的文章，这听起来会很熟悉，我将主要集中在说，我谈论设计沥青甲板的方式实际上适用于想法和其他很多东西。

 The way I make things easy to understand on a pitch deck or a slide  is to make it legible, I make it simple and I make it obvious.

我让事情在沥青甲板或幻灯片上容易理解的方式是让它清晰可读，我使它简单，我使它显而易见。

In  today's presentation we're just going to focus on making your idea legible, which is going  to sound interesting, for clarity.

在今天的演讲中，为了清晰起见，我们将专注于让你的想法清晰易懂，这听起来会很有趣。

In my essay, I talked about how at demo day  when our startups are presenting to a room full of a thousand investors it's kind  of an interesting audience.

在我的文章中，我谈到了在演示日，当我们的初创公司向满满一千名投资者的房间展示时，它是一种有趣的观众。

Number one, the audience is filled with really old people.

第一，观众都是真正的老人。

They  tend to not have very good eyesight as a result.

因此，他们的视力往往不是很好。

They all can't sit in  the front row like you lovely people.

他们都不能像你们这些可爱的人一样坐在前排。

Some of them have to sit in the  way back and stand up.

他们中的一些人不得不坐在回去的路上站起来。

That means if you create a legible slide, they have  to be ones that even old people in the back row with bad eyesight can  read.

这意味着如果你创建一个清晰的幻灯片，它们必须是那些即使是后排视力不好的老人也能读懂的幻灯片。

How does that apply to a legible idea? Well, basically you are designing a  slide that democratizes the idea, so people who are blind or people who are ignorant,  you're basically designing something for everyone in the room, not just the ones in the  first row.

这怎么适用于一个清晰的想法呢？嗯，基本上你是在设计一个让想法民主化的幻灯片，所以盲人或无知的人，你基本上是为房间里的每个人设计东西，而不仅仅是第一排的人。

A legible idea can be understood by people who know nothing about your  business.

一个清晰的想法可以被那些对你的业务一无所知的人所理解。

That will make things very clear to the widest possible audience.

这会让尽可能多的观众看得很清楚。

This is super  important because you will talk about your company more than anything else.

这一点非常重要，因为你会更多地谈论你的公司。

It is actually  the thing that we are really great at at Y Combinator.

实际上，这就是我们在Y Combinator上非常出色的地方。

We have our companies  constantly practice talking about their startup.

我们让我们的公司不断练习谈论他们的创业公司。

Startup School curriculum is designed around helping you constantly  practice talking about your startup.

初创学校的课程是围绕帮助你不断练习谈论你的初创公司而设计的。

This is because you are going to need a lot  of people if you're going to become a billion-dollar company.

这是因为如果你要成为一家价值数十亿美元的公司，你将需要很多人。

You are trying to find  a co-founder.

你正在尝试寻找一个联合创始人。

You have to have a way of talking about your company clearly, whether  you're getting users or investors or employees or shareholders.

你必须有一种清楚地谈论你的公司的方式，无论你得到的是用户还是投资者，还是员工或股东。

You have to get really good  at this, and you have to be able to do it quickly and efficiently.

你必须在这方面做得很好，而且你必须能够快速有效地做到这一点。

Here  are things to avoid that makes things not clear, that makes your idea muddy.

这里有一些事情要避免，这会使事情变得不清楚，这会使你的想法变得混乱。

The  first is ambiguity, so that's obviously the opposite of clear or straightforward.

第一个是模棱两可，所以这显然是明确或直截了当的反义词。

Something's a little  abstract.

有点抽象。

Something can be interpreted in two ways, and therefore, it might take a question  to understand what you do.

有些事情可以用两种方式来解释，因此，可能需要一个问题来理解你在做什么。

Complexity.

复杂性。

I have a very specific definition of complexity.

我对复杂性有一个非常明确的定义。

If  you look at the root word, simple and complex come from the same root and  having to do with twists or braids.

如果你看词根，简单和复杂来自同一个词根，与扭曲或编织有关。

Things that are simple are ones that have  one braid and things that are complex have multiple braids.

简单的东西有一个辫子，复杂的东西有多个辫子。

They're intertwined with one another.

它们彼此交织在一起。

 A simple idea is one idea that does not fold.

一个简单的想法是一个不会折叠的想法。

A complex idea are ideas  that are intertwined.

复杂的想法是相互交织在一起的想法。

Simplicity means you are not trying to mix a bunch of things  in your description.

简单性意味着你不会试图在你的描述中混合一大堆东西。

Mystery.

神秘。

This is an odd one.

这是一个奇怪的问题。

What I mean is anything where  it's like I'm not going to understand what is going on when you're talking about  your company.

我的意思是，当你谈论你的公司时，我不会理解发生了什么事情。

Jargon is one, obviously.

显然，行话就是其中之一。

Any words that I don't understand.

任何我听不懂的话。

Anything that's fake,  like indefinite pronouns, so if you just use this, et cetera, and you don't describe  what those nouns are and then things that you just suggest but aren't explicit about.

任何虚假的东西，比如不定代词，所以如果你只用这个，等等，你没有描述那些名词是什么，然后你只是建议但不明确的东西。

 The last is ignorable.

最后一个是可以忽略的。

What I mean by that is there is some language that  we will just ignore.

我的意思是我们会忽略一些语言。

In UX design, people will create a sort of blindness to  things that they don't want to look at or they don't find to be important  value.

在用户体验设计中，人们会对他们不想看的东西或他们认为不重要的东西造成一种盲目。

For example, ad blindness is a big one that people sort of understand.

例如，广告盲目是人们可以理解的一个很大的问题。

The  thing is when you're talking about ideas, there's a way of using language that is  also easily ignorable.

问题是，当你谈论想法时，有一种使用语言的方式也很容易被忽略。

Things that just won't stick in your head.

那些不会留在你脑子里的东西。

Things like marketing speak.

市场营销之类的东西。

 There's probably lots of stuff that you've heard about that.

你可能听说过很多关于这方面的事情。

MBA speak, weird kind of  like puff yourself up.

工商管理硕士的演讲，有点怪异，就像把自己吹起来。

Talk that doesn't give any extra information and then buzz words.

不会给出任何额外信息的谈话，然后是嗡嗡的话。

 When you say certain types of words that as an investor I've heard over and  over again, or I will equate with zero information or value then I will ignore  them.

当你说某些类型的话，作为一个投资者，我听到了一遍又一遍，或者我会等同于零的信息或价值，然后我会忽略它们。

The result is parts of your pitch will end up being not even heard  by me and therefore, I will not remember them.

结果是你的部分推介最终将不会被我听到，因此，我不会记得它们。

What you want to do is  be conversational.

你想要做的是对话。

A great pitch is one where you can tell it to your mom  and she gets it.

一个很好的推介就是你可以告诉你的妈妈，她会明白的。

She's proud of you.

她为你骄傲。

She's not going to shake her head.

她不会摇头的。

 That means it's got to be conversational, and that's really good for word of mouth  because we talk in normal conversational speak.

这意味着它必须是对话的，这对口碑非常好，因为我们用正常的对话说话。

We don't talk like an MBA.

我们说话不像MBA

We don't  talk like CEOs all the time, so it's best to talk conversationally.

我们并不总是像首席执行官那样说话，所以最好是交谈。

Again, avoid jargon.

同样，避免使用行话。

 Words that are only understood or used by your industry.

只有您的行业才能理解或使用的词语。

No preamble.

没有前言。

I'll have some  examples of this, but if you want to be clear, let's go straight to what  you want to talk about.

我会举一些例子，但如果你想弄清楚，让我们直接谈你想谈的。

Let's not have a winding path to eventually getting there.

让我们不要走一条弯弯曲曲的道路最终到达那里。

 The last one, and this one's a big one, is being reproducible.

最后一个，这是一个大的，是可复制的。

When I hear  your idea, can I imagine it in my mind? Can I see what I would  have to build to create your company? If I don't have that, then I have  no picture in my head about what your company does, and until I have that  picture, I can't ask any of the questions that helps me understand if I'm excited  about you or understand other nuances of your business.

当我听到你的想法，我能想象它在我的脑海里吗？我可以看看我需要建立什么才能创建你的公司吗？如果我没有这一点，那么我脑海中就没有关于贵公司业务的图片，在我有了这些图片之前，我不能问任何问题来帮助我理解我是否对你感到兴奋，或者理解你的业务的其他细微差别。

To make things reproducible I need  to know nouns.

为了让事情可以重现，我需要知道名词。

I need to have objects that I'm going to imagine in my  head.

我需要有一些东西，我要在我的脑海中想象。

There's three types of nouns that I should understand from your startup idea.

从你的创业理念中，我应该理解三种类型的名词。

The  first one is what are you making? That should be really clear.

第一个是你在做什么？这一点应该很清楚。

What is the  problem, and then who is the customer? The two are kind of related to the  market, but I should have these kind of three nouns in my head.

问题是什么，那么谁是客户？这两个词都与市场有关，但我应该把这三个名词记在脑子里。

Let's go  through some examples.

让我们来看一些例子。

This says we are going to transform the relationship between individuals and  information.

这意味着我们将改变个人和信息之间的关系。

This sucks.

这糟透了。

The thing is we see this all the time.

问题是我们经常看到这种情况。

Number one, all  the nouns that you see down here are abstract.

第一，你在下面看到的所有名词都是抽象的。

They're ideas.

它们是想法。

I can't reproduce, based  off of this.

基于这个，我不能复制。

It has zero informational value.

它的信息价值为零。

I still have to ask questions to  answer the three nouns that I need to have.

我仍然需要问题来回答我需要的三个名词。

This is a bad description for  a company.

对于一家公司来说，这不是一个好的描述。

We will see stuff that starts like this when we ask to describe  what your company's going to make.

当我们要求描述您的公司将生产什么时，我们将看到像这样开始的东西。

I don't even want to read it, but basically  it starts talking about the story of the company or basically it's like in the  beginning there was this problem and we're going to go through this issue.

我甚至不想读它，但基本上它开始谈论公司的故事，或者基本上它就像在一开始有这个问题，我们将经历这个问题。

Then there's  these bad guys and they showed up, but then who's going to save us? We're  finally here to save...

然后是这些坏人，他们出现了，但是谁来救我们呢？我们终于来拯救.。

And you're like, "I have to read another thousand applications.

你就会说，“我还得再读一千份申请书。

That's  not going to work for me." This is the description on the actual application that  Airbnb put to YC.

这对我不起作用。“这是Airbnb向YC提供的对实际应用程序的描述。

Airbnb is the first online marketplace that lets travelers book rooms  with locals instead of hotels.

Airbnb是第一个允许旅行者向当地人而不是酒店预订房间的在线市场。

It's concise.

很简洁。

It's descriptive.

这是描述性的。

I understand what they're building.

我知道他们在建造什么。

I  have a sense for what they're making and then I can start thinking about my  other two ideas of whether I'm excited about it and then am I going to  like this team.

我知道他们在做什么，然后我可以开始思考我的另外两个想法，我是否对此感到兴奋，然后我会不会喜欢这支球队。

Here's Dropbox.

这是Dropbox

Synchronizes files across your or your team's computers.

在您或您的团队的计算机上同步文件。

The thing  about this is it's refreshing but also there's no pretense.

关于这个的事情是它令人耳目一新，但也没有伪装。

They aren't playing defense.

他们不是在防守。

I  see a lot of company descriptions where they're like, "I'm worried about this," or, "I've  gotten this kind of feedback." They give up clarity to make themselves look bigger and  blow themselves up or make themselves try to look more interesting.

我看到很多公司的描述都是这样的，“我很担心这个，”或者“我得到了这样的反馈。”他们放弃清晰，让自己看起来更大，把自己炸飞，或者让自己看起来更有趣。

They're trying to protect  themselves against something way ahead of time.

他们试图提前保护自己不受某些东西的伤害。

The whole problem is usually what it ends  up doing is it brings me farther away from you, all that padding that you've  put on yourself.

整个问题通常是它最终所做的是它让我离你更远，所有你给自己穿上的垫子。

Here's a description from a company in the current batch.

下面是当前批次中某公司的说明。

Luminize building  x-ray vision for soldiers and first responders.

为士兵和第一反应人员照明建筑x射线视觉。

We don't have to go deep into the  details.

我们不必深入细节。

I don't need to understand how they exactly do this, et cetera.

我不需要了解他们到底是怎么做到的，等等。

This creates  a foundation for my curiosity.

这为我的好奇心奠定了基础。

Now I will start from here to try to figure  out oh, how do you do this? Is this the right team to do this?  How far along are they? Do they have traction? Do they have customers? I start  going down the route of asking all the right questions based off this one description.

现在我将从这里开始尝试弄清楚哦，你是如何做到的？这是做这件事的合适团队吗？他们多久了？他们有牵引力吗？他们有顾客吗？我开始根据这一描述提出所有正确的问题。

 This is a good one.

这是一个很好的。

Here's another one.

这里还有一个。

So [Vahan] in the current batch is  building LinkedIn for the next billion internet users.

因此，[Vahan]目前正在为下一个10亿互联网用户打造LinkedIn。

It doesn't perfectly connect me to what  they're sort of making, but I'm intrigued.

这并不能完美地将我和他们正在制作的东西联系起来，但我很感兴趣。

I'm excited about someone building into LinkedIn and  I know it's some kind of social network for business people.

我对有人将LinkedIn内置到LinkedIn感到兴奋，我知道它是商业人士的某种社交网络。

Now I'm curious about  how.

现在我很好奇是怎么回事。

I don't need you to answer how in the description, but I understand what  you're doing and then now I can start making questions in my head about how  would I evaluate whether this is working or successful or promising or not.

我不需要你回答描述中如何，但我知道你在做什么，然后我可以开始在我的头脑中提出问题，关于我将如何评估这是否有效、成功或有前途。

Is this  the right team? Do they have a certain amount of traction, et cetera.

这是正确的团队吗？他们有没有一定的牵引力，等等。

It gets  me on the right track.

它让我走上了正确的道路。

The reason I use this example is because we have  a lot of companies who try to use the X for Y, and what I  mean by that is LinkedIn for whatever or Uber for blank or Airbnb for blank.

我使用这个例子的原因是因为我们有很多公司试图用X代表Y，我的意思是LinkedIn代表任何东西，Uber代表空白，或者Airbnb代表空白。

 That X for Y is super useful because it allows you to shortcut business model  and some kind of complex behavior and then attach it to some other vertical or  something that you're trying to make work.

X for Y非常有用，因为它允许您捷径商业模式和某种复杂的行为，然后将其附加到其他垂直或您试图使之工作的东西上。

X for Y is okay, but most people  abuse it or do it incorrectly, so I'm going to give you some tips.

X换Y是可以的，但大多数人滥用它或做错了，所以我将给你一些提示。

First,  should you use X for Y? Sorry for the illegibility.

首先，你应该用X代表Y吗？很抱歉看不清。

Number one, is X a  household name? This should be like a billion-dollar company.

第一，X是家喻户晓的名字吗？这应该是一家价值数十亿美元的公司。

You can't use your uncle's pet  shoe store as the X for this because people don't know your uncle's pet shoe  store and they don't know if it's successful or not.

你不能用你叔叔的宠物鞋店作为X，因为人们不知道你叔叔的宠物鞋店，他们也不知道它是否成功。

Everyone, as many people should  know about this as possible and for an investor it should be clear that it's  a billion-dollar company or opportunity.

每个人，尽可能多的人应该知道这一点，对于投资者来说，应该清楚这是一家价值数十亿美元的公司或机会。

Everyone has to agree that it is successful, so you  could have a really big X, everyone knows about it, but it's infamous, so that  people don't think it's successful so be careful of that.

每个人都必须同意它是成功的，所以你可以有一个非常大的X，每个人都知道它，但它是臭名昭著的，所以人们不认为它是成功的，所以要小心。

Does Y want X? Is  it really clear why the target that you're going after wants this kind of model  applied to it? This kind of solution applied to it, whether it's Airbnb four or  Airbnb or Uber four, et cetera.

Y想要X吗？为什么你要追逐的目标想要将这种模型应用于它，这真的很清楚吗？这种解决方案适用于它，无论是Airbnb 4，还是Airbnb或Uber 4，等等。

It should be really clear that that's a segment  that's either missing it, it's not being served well by the other one, and also  that those people want to have that kind of model.

应该非常清楚的是，这是一个不是缺少它的部分，另一个没有很好地提供服务，而且那些人也希望有这样的模式。

The third one is Y  should be a huge market, so if you're building X for Y and the last  part doesn't sound like a really big business, that's not going to work well for  you.

第三个是Y应该是一个巨大的市场，所以如果你为Y构建X，而最后一部分听起来不像是一个真正的大企业，这对你来说不会很好。

You're essentially saying that you are something, but that's a subset.

你本质上是在说你是某种东西，但那只是一个子集。

What we want  to make sure is that subset feels like it could be really, really big.

我们想要确定的是，子集感觉它可能真的，真的很大。

If  you choose a subset that sounds like it's going to be really, really small, investors  won't be as interested.

如果你选择的子集听起来非常小，投资者就不会那么感兴趣了。

It means that I'm worried that you will not have enough  potential headroom to grow to become a billion-dollar company.

这意味着我担心你没有足够的潜在净空来成长为一家价值数十亿美元的公司。

Here's an example that doesn't work.

这里有一个不起作用的例子。

 We had a company in the batch that started off by describing themselves as buffer  for Snapchat.

我们有一家公司一开始就把自己描述为Snapchat的缓冲器。

Buffer is a nice company, but definitely smaller than Snapchat, so don't want  to do that.

Buffer是一家不错的公司，但肯定比Snapchat小，所以不想这么做。

Basic summary for this section, lead with what, not why or how.

本节的基本总结，以什么开头，而不是为什么或如何。

 You don't need all that other stuff.

你不需要其他的东西。

That stuff gets in the way of your  clarity, for the most part.

这些东西在很大程度上妨碍了你的清晰度。

I'll read a thousand applications every single batch and it's  a really hard thing to do.

我会阅读一千个申请每一批，这是一件非常困难的事情。

Basically even though it's my job, it's really, really  difficult to have that much focus and attention across all these different applications.

基本上，尽管这是我的工作，但要在所有这些不同的应用程序中获得如此多的关注和关注是非常困难的。

I need  some empathy.

我需要一些同理心。

I need you to help me out.

我需要你帮我。

What we want is that when  I bring up your application and I'm looking at it, let's make our intimate time  really pleasurable.

我们想要的是，当我提出你的申请，我看着它，让我们的亲密时间真的很愉快。

Let's make the time that I spend on your idea very efficient.

让我们把我花在你的想法上的时间变得非常有效率。

I'll  look at it, I'll understand really clearly, I'll move around your application.

我会看一看，我会非常清楚地理解，我会在你的申请中移动。

I'll be like,  "Oh, I'm kind of excited.

我会说，“哦，我有点兴奋。

Maybe there's going to have this," and I'll look at  that part and I'm like, "Oh, they do have it.

也许会有这个，“我会看着那部分，我会说，”哦，他们确实有。

That sounds awesome.

听起来很棒。

Oh, what  about this? Ooh, that sounds awesome too." What we don't want is me to go  like, "Oh, what are they talking about?", then I have to go to your website.

哦，那这个呢？哦，听起来也很棒。“我们不想让我去，”哦，他们在说什么？“，然后我必须去你的网站。

 I'm like, "Hm, don't know what they're talking about.

我想，“嗯，不知道他们在说什么。

I don't know how this works."  I go back to it.

我不知道这是怎么回事。“我又回去了。

I try to figure something else out.

我试着想出别的办法。

I try to  see if some other partner might understand what you're doing, et cetera.

我试着看看其他伙伴是否能理解你在做什么，等等。

Super inefficient.

超级低效。

Where  is there going to be room for me to get excited as a result? To  be efficient we need to be concise.

哪里会有空间让我因此而兴奋呢？为了有效率，我们需要简洁。

Concise.

简洁。

The best way I want to keep  this in mind is to use some examples.

我想记住这一点的最好方法是使用一些例子。

Here's some things I need you to  keep in mind.

我需要你记住一些事情。

Yes, I want you to be concise.

是的，我希望你能简明扼要。

Use as few words as  possible and what I want you to understand is the concision actually gives me secondary  information about you as a team.

用尽可能少的话，我想让你明白的是，简洁实际上给了我关于你作为一个团队的次要信息。

It lets me; 1) Know that you have thought  deeply about your idea.

它让我；1)知道你已经对你的想法进行了深入的思考。

Because you've thought so deeply about it and because you've practiced  talking about it so much and you've gotten really good at getting people excited and  understanding your thing really quickly, you probably have figured out how to do it in  the short amount of time.

因为你已经对它进行了如此深入的思考，而且你已经练习了这么多地谈论它，而且你已经非常善于让人们兴奋起来，并且非常快地理解了你的事情，你可能已经找到了如何在短时间内做到这一点。

It lets me know that this is a founder that  has thought deeply about the idea.

它让我知道，这是一个对这个想法进行了深入思考的创始人。

The other thing about being concise is it shows  me that you are efficient, and if you're efficient with your words then you're probably  efficient with your thoughts.

简明扼要的另一件事是，它向我表明你是高效的，如果你对你的话很有效率，那么你可能对你的思想很有效率。

That means you're probably also efficient with your actions.

这意味着你的行动可能也很有效率。

What that  means is that I will start to believe that you understand what is most important  about your business, you understand how to communicate it clearly and you might actually know  how to always figure out the most important part of what to do about your  company to make it grow, to make it work, et cetera.

这意味着，我将开始相信，你明白什么是你的业务最重要的，你知道如何清晰地沟通，你可能真的知道如何总是找出对你的公司来说最重要的部分，让它成长，让它运作，诸如此类的事情。

There's some minimum stuff  that we want to have, even though we're trying to be as concise as possible.

有一些我们想要的最低限度的东西，即使我们试图尽可能的简洁。

 Again, I want to understand the nouns, so if we're so concise that I can't  understand these, then your concision is too much.

再一次，我想要理解名词，所以如果我们如此简洁以至于我不能理解这些，那么你的简洁就太过分了。

The other is I want to get  to this point when I read the concision or the short version of whatever it  is you're talking about, because again, I know there's a hundred thousand reasons why your  company is great, but when I'm reading your application I'm only going to maybe remember  two to three of them, so we have to try to make sure those most  important ones come up to the top.

另一个原因是，当我阅读你所说的简明或简短版本时，我想达到这一点，因为，我再次知道，你的公司之所以伟大，有十万个理由，但当我读你的申请时，我可能只会记住其中的两到三个，所以我们必须努力确保那些最重要的理由出现在顶端。

This is a real Startup School company description.

这是一个真正的创业学校公司的描述。

 It's an online e-commerce store.

这是一家在线电子商务商店。

I can picture what it is, but again, it's not  a description that helps me get excited about it.

我可以想象它是什么，但再一次，它不是一个描述，帮助我对它感到兴奋。

It doesn't help me lead to  all the other things.

它并不能帮助我找到其他的东西。

I have to do now more work to understand why this  is fast growing and has potential.

我现在必须做更多的工作来理解为什么这是快速增长的和有潜力的。

I also don't know, based on this, some nouns.

我也不知道，基于这个，一些名词。

 I don't know exactly who the customer is.

我不知道确切的客户是谁。

Is it people that they're selling stuff  to or are they making an e-commerce store for other shop owners? There's ambiguity.

他们是把东西卖给别人，还是为其他店主开了一个电子商务商店？有模棱两可的地方。

IT  security services.

IT安全服务。

This is most of the descriptions that we see on Startup School.

这是我们在创业学校看到的大部分描述。

It  makes it really, really hard for us to understand it.

这让我们真的很难理解它。

A meritocratic decision support system.

精英决策支持系统。

 The thing is I want to know for what? For whom? I don't even understand  what the problem is that they're solving, based off of this.

我想知道的是为什么？为了谁？基于这一点，我甚至不明白他们正在解决的问题是什么。

Is it because a  lot of people have not merit...

是不是因为很多人都没有功劳.。

Basically I have to ask so many questions in  my head to figure out why did they get to this sort of description.

基本上，我必须在我的头脑中问这么多问题，以弄清楚为什么他们会有这样的描述。

Learn  and sharing knowledge about data science and artificial intelligence.

学习和分享有关数据科学和人工智能的知识。

Sounds more like a mission.

听起来更像是任务。

I  can't tell what the product is and how they're starting to go about it.

我不知道产品是什么，他们是如何开始着手的。

I  couldn't reproduce this.

我无法复制这个。

If I had 10 companies build, based off this description, you'd have  10 very different products.

如果我有10个公司建立，根据这个描述，你会有10个非常不同的产品。

The other thing that's odd about company descriptions is you guys  tend to capitalize and make proper nouns very weird words and phrases.

关于公司描述的另一件奇怪的事情是，你们倾向于大写，并且使用专有名词，非常奇怪的单词和短语。

You should not  do that.

你不应该那样做。

It's not like a magazine title, and it makes me think sometimes you're  emphasizing the wrong things.

它不像一个杂志标题，它让我觉得有时候你强调的东西是错误的。

You're thinking that data science and artificial intelligence is the thing  that's going to make me excited and the thing is like those are the buzz  words, those are the solutions, and it makes me worried that you haven't started with  a problem.

你认为数据科学和人工智能是让我兴奋的东西，事情就像那些流行语，这些是解决方案，这让我担心你还没有开始解决问题。

Let's go into an example of how to adjust a description.

让我们来看一个如何调整描述的示例。

Here's a  much longer one.

这里有一个更长的。

Our company will make low-cost and low-power consumption medical devices based on  artificial intelligence and IOT suitable for sub-Saharan communities.

我们公司将制造适合撒哈拉以南地区社区的基于人工智能和物联网的低成本、低功耗医疗设备。

Relatively clear.

相对清晰。

I could understand it reading  it, but it's not the most concise form of this, and I feel like there's  a lot of things get in the way.

我读它可以理解它，但这不是最简洁的形式，我觉得有很多东西阻碍了它。

When I work with companies to help  shrink and reduce and improve their descriptions so that I will get the most out  of it...

当我与公司合作，帮助缩小、减少和改进他们的描述，以便我将最大限度地利用它…

I want to talk you through the process.

我想告诉你整个过程。

The first thing I want  to do is just figure out what are the nouns in the description.

我想做的第一件事就是弄清楚描述中的名词是什么。

Here we  go.

我们开始吧。

Our company medical devices for sub-Saharan communities.

我们公司为撒哈拉以南的社区提供医疗设备。

Oh, shit! We're almost done, right? Everything  else that gets added on here, whatever verb, adjectives or adverbs you want, you want  to be really careful.

哦，妈的！我们快完成了，对吧？这里添加的所有其他东西，无论你想要什么动词，形容词或副词，你都要非常小心。

You want to know is it getting maximum punch for this?  Really, the verb is going to be...

你想知道它是不是因为这个得到了最大的冲力？真的，动词将会是.。

Usage is you're making something, et cetera.

用法是你在做东西，等等。

Usually  it's going to be whatever the product.

通常它将会是什么产品。

The verb is like the thing that we're  making.

这个动词就像我们正在制作的东西。

If we're thinking about this in an active voice structure.

如果我们在主动语态结构中思考这个问题。

The subject, the verb  and then the object, the customer, the market, the people who we're going after.

主语，动词，然后是宾语，顾客，市场，我们要追逐的人。

Everything  else, if we add anything back to this, I really want to be really careful  about why we're going to add back to it.

其他的一切，如果我们把任何东西加回去，我真的很想非常小心，为什么我们要把它加回去。

Is that going to be the  stuff that makes me excited? The artificial intelligence IOT-suitable stuff.

这会是让我兴奋的东西吗？人工智能物联网适合的东西。

That's like how they're [inaudible]  the technology, and I'm more worried that they're going to use buzz words to describe  it.

这就像他们是如何[听不到]技术，我更担心他们会用流行语来描述它。

Hopefully that's like a secret weapon that you have, but I bet it's not  the defining characteristics of whether this company is successful or not.

希望这就像你拥有的秘密武器，但我敢打赌，这不是这家公司成功与否的决定性特征。

Then up here I  see two modifiers for medical devices; low cost, low power consumption.

然后在这里我看到了医疗设备的两个修改器；低成本，低功耗。

Low cost, I can  definitely see.

成本低，我绝对看得出来。

That's super interesting.

真是太有趣了。

If you make a low-cost device in a sub-Saharan community,  then I'm like, "Oh, that's interesting.

如果你在撒哈拉沙漠以南的社区制造一个低成本的设备，那么我会说，“哦，这很有趣。

That's really interesting because it's hard just to make  something for developing countries, but to make it so that it's actually affordable for them?  That'd be interesting." The low-power consumption, I can give or take there.

这真的很有趣，因为仅仅为发展中国家制造东西是很难的，但要让它们真正负担得起呢？那会很有趣。“低功耗，我可以给或拿。

I'd have to  know more about the company to know whether that's actually crucial to understanding whether this  company has an unfair advantage or not.

我必须更多地了解这家公司，才能知道这对于了解这家公司是否具有不公平的优势是否真的至关重要。

If I was to redo this it would  come out to we create affordable medical devices for sub-Saharan Africa.

如果我要重做这件事，我们将为撒哈拉以南非洲创造负担得起的医疗设备。

Some people are going  to be very squeamish about this.

有些人会对此非常紧张。

A lot of founders are worried it's like, "You're  putting me in a box, man! It's too reductive.

很多创始人担心这就像是，“你把我放在一个盒子里，伙计！这太简约了。”

My business is complex.

我的生意很复杂。

I do  a lot of things, and a lot of things make me great.

我做了很多事情，很多事情让我变得伟大。

I want to  tell you all of them." The thing is, you don't have time, and I know  it.

我想告诉你所有的事情。“问题是，你没有时间，我知道这一点。

As an investor, there's no investor that thinks any business is simple and easy.

作为一个投资者，没有一个投资者认为任何业务都是简单和容易的。

 I just don't think that from the default.

我只是不认为这是默认的。

You shouldn't be worried that I'm going  to think something small of it.

你不应该担心我会把它想得很小。

Again, you want to be careful of the defense  on here...

再说一遍，你要小心这里的防御.

Once I get to this, then I'll start asking the other questions.

一旦我到了这一步，我就会开始问其他的问题。

It  creates that foundation for curiosity.

它创造了好奇心的基础。

All right.

好的。

We're pretty much at the end.

我们差不多快结束了。

The best  way to help me, and I would love for you to help me, is to  be clear and concise.

帮助我的最好方式，我也希望你能帮助我，就是清晰和简洁。

Thank you very much.

非常感谢。

All right.

好的。

So, we'll do a couple  of questions about this presentation, and then I'll have Adora join me and then we'll  answer questions about anything.

所以，我们将就这个演示做几个问题，然后我会让Adora加入我，然后我们将回答关于任何事情的问题。

Right here.
Speaker 2:Thanks for the presentation, Kevin.

就在这儿。演讲者2：谢谢你的介绍，凯文。

You talked a lot about what is presenting an application,  but you also hear a lot of pitches, especially in demo day.

您谈论了很多关于什么是呈现应用程序的内容，但您也听到了很多推介，特别是在演示日。

What, in your  opinion, are the killer tips to make a great pitch and get people to like  you in a demo day?
Kevin:So, he's asking about I talked a lot here about writing the idea for the  application, how that might be different for companies who are pitching or presenting to investors  on a demo day.

在你看来，在演示日让人们喜欢你的杀手级技巧是什么？凯文：所以，他是问我在这里谈了很多关于编写应用程序的想法，对于那些在演示日向投资者推销或演示的公司来说，这可能会有什么不同。

What are things that we look for.

我们寻找的东西是什么。

I talk about, in  that essay that I wrote how to pitch, how to design a pitch deck and  talk about how to present the ideas.

在我写的那篇文章中，我谈到了如何投球，如何设计投球甲板，以及如何呈现想法。

The main thing to keep in mind is  that...

要记住的主要事情是.

So let me describe the situation.

让我来描述一下情况。

So, demo day at Y Combinator, it's like  1000 people in the room and you have two minutes to talk about your company  and show what you've built to get them excited, and then there's going to be  200 other companies that will do the same thing on the stage.

所以，Y Combinator的演示日，就像房间里有1000人，你有两分钟的时间谈论你的公司，展示你已经建立的让他们兴奋的东西，然后会有200家其他公司在舞台上做同样的事情。

It's an extremely  hard problem.

这是一个极其困难的问题。

In two minutes, what do you get across? How do we get it  so that in two minutes, a company on average will then raise 1.5 million dollars  after demo day? The thing to keep in mind is that, yes, there's a hundred  reasons why your company is great.

两分钟后，你能通过什么？我们如何才能在两分钟内让一家公司在演示日之后平均募集到150万美元？需要记住的是，是的，你的公司之所以伟大有一百个原因。

You cannot say all of them in two minutes.

你不能在两分钟内说完所有的内容。

 You can't say them in a short conversation when you're meeting a bunch of the  investors inside of the room.

当你在房间里会见一群投资者时，你不能在简短的谈话中说出这些话。

There's like maybe five to six points that are really,  really great about your company.

对于你的公司来说，可能有5到6点是非常棒的。

Maybe the investor will remember one or two of them.

也许投资者会记得其中的一两个。

 One of them has to be remembering what you do.

其中之一必须是记住你所做的。

The goal of you being  on stage is not to say all the things that's great about your company.

你站在舞台上的目的并不是说你公司的所有优点。

It's  to get people to want to have a conversation with you, to say, "I can't  ignore having a conversation with that person." That's what a great pitch does.

这是为了让人们想要和你对话，说，“我不能忽视和那个人的对话。”这就是伟大的投球所做的。

What that  means is you don't make the slides be the thing that they remember.

这意味着你不会让幻灯片成为他们记忆中的东西。

You want  to make yourself.

你想让自己。

It's about your presence, the way you talk, how confident you are,  et cetera.

这是关于你的存在，你说话的方式，你有多自信，等等。

Basically, do you present yourself in a way that people go, "I want  to interact with you."? The presentation is more about making the founders look formidable and  impressive.

基本上，你是以一种人们会说“我想和你互动”的方式来表现自己吗？演示文稿更多的是让创始人看起来令人敬畏和令人印象深刻。

They're using language that everyone understands and is clear, but feels inevitable.

他们使用的语言是每个人都能理解和清楚的，但感觉是不可避免的。

The goal  is not to do all this fancy stuff.

我们的目标不是做所有这些花哨的事情。

It's to do very simple fundamentals and  talk about them in a way so that everyone will understand.

它是做非常简单的基本原理，并以一种方式谈论它们，以便每个人都能理解。

Right there.
Speaker 3:I applied a couple times, and the one question is always the bane of my  existence is the what's the surprising or amusing thing that you've noticed about the world.

就在那儿。演讲者3：我申请了几次，唯一的问题就是我存在的祸根是你注意到的这个世界上令人惊讶或有趣的事情是什么。

 Could you provide some clarity in terms of what you're looking for there? Is it  something about business or is it something witty? I spend way too much time on  that question.
Kevin:We have a question on the application to YC that is about explain what you-
Speaker 3:It's like what's something or amusing that you [crosstalk]
Kevin:Yeah, so share something surprising or amusing that you've noticed about the world.

你能提供一些关于你在那里寻找的东西的明确性吗？是生意上的事还是机智的事？我在这个问题上花了太多时间。凯文：我们对YC的申请有一个问题，是关于解释你是什么-演讲者3：就像你[相声]是什么或有趣的事情一样。凯文：是的，所以分享一些你注意到的关于这个世界的令人惊讶或有趣的东西。

He's saying  I'm having a hard time with the question, so any tips about that.

他说我很难回答这个问题，所以有什么建议吗？

Again, we  at YC, we don't really judge ideas.

再说一次，我们在YC，我们并不真的评判想法。

I talked a lot about how to present  your idea, but the idea is a reflection of how you think.

我谈了很多关于如何表达你的想法，但是这个想法反映了你的想法。

Everything that we  have in the application is to try to understand more about the team and the  people who are behind the company.

我们在应用程序中所做的一切都是为了更多地了解团队和公司背后的人。

A question like that is very obvious.

这样的问题是很明显的。

It lets  us know how do you think about stuff? What do you find interesting or amusing?  Part of it is that YC is optimized to spend time with lots of people  every single week for dinner, and I want to spend time with people I like,  people who are not assholes and they're kind of interesting.

它让我们知道你是如何看待事物的？你觉得什么有趣或有趣？部分原因是YC经过优化，每周都和很多人一起吃晚餐，我想花时间和我喜欢的人在一起，那些人不是混蛋，他们有点意思。

That kind of question...

这种问题.。

It's  basically a dating question.

这基本上是一个约会问题。

It's letting me know, "Oh, I want to buy this guy  dinner!" Right here.
Speaker 4:In my example it's a very specific financial problem that I'm trying to attack, so  should I work on trying to make that very complex and very specific problem something  that anyone understands or should I talk to the right people that understand that type  of problem?
Kevin:Gotcha.

它让我知道，“哦，我想请这家伙吃饭！”就在这儿。演讲者4：在我的例子中，这是一个非常具体的财务问题，我试图攻击的是，所以我应该努力使这个非常复杂和非常具体的问题成为任何人都理解的东西，或者我应该和理解这种类型问题的正确的人交谈吗？明白了。

The question is he's working on a very complex fintech solution or app, and  he's wondering it's like how do I balance this talking to the right people so  I can use jargon and who understand the complexity versus making a version of the  idea that everybody can sort of understand.

问题是他正在开发一个非常复杂的金融科技解决方案或应用程序，他想知道这就像我如何平衡与合适的人的交谈，以便我可以使用行话和理解复杂性的人，而不是制作一个每个人都可以理解的想法的版本。

The answer is you have to do both.

答案是你必须两者兼得。

 Everyone that you're talking to; industry, your users, customers or your business partners, you get  a shortcut with them, and that's most of the people you're going to interact with.

与你交谈的每个人；行业，你的用户，客户或你的业务合作伙伴，你都能找到他们的捷径，这就是你要与之互动的大多数人。

 The thing to know about that is you need to have that developed, that customer/business  partner speech, so that you're efficient in talking with them.

关于这一点，需要知道的是，你需要开发客户/业务合作伙伴的语言，这样你才能有效地与他们交谈。

The thing is you also  have this other one, if you're interested in outside investment, having the press want to  talk about you et cetera.

问题是你也有另一个，如果你对外部投资感兴趣，让媒体想要谈论你等等。

You need to have a good story-telling narrative for non-experts.

对于非专家来说，你需要有一个好的讲故事的故事。

 Really, it is not one or the other, it is how you have to do  both.

真的，这不是一个或另一个，而是如何你必须做到这两个。

The thing is for fintech people, because there's so much around all these other  people who just understand this stuff, they rarely practice this other thing because they just  assume it's always going to be like that.

事情是对金融科技人来说的，因为周围有太多的人只了解这些东西，他们很少练习其他的东西，因为他们只是假设它永远都会是那样的。

When they come to YC, it's the  first time they want money from investors who might not know about their space or  they want to talk to press who's not going to understand what they're doing, et  cetera.

当他们来到YC时，这是他们第一次想要从可能不知道他们的空间的投资者那里获得资金，或者他们想要和那些不知道他们在做什么的媒体交谈，等等。

Right here sitting down.
Speaker 5:How do the best, most memorable applications make you feel?
Kevin:How do the best, most memorable applications make me feel? Probably the best ones make  me go like, "Fuck! I want to joint their company!" That's like the best ones,  right? It's like, "Man, these guys seem really cool, they're super smart.

坐在这里。演讲者5：最好的，最令人难忘的应用程序让你有什么感觉？凯文：最好、最令人难忘的应用程序让我有什么感觉？也许最好的那些让我想，“操！我想加入他们的公司！”这是最好的，对吧？就像，“伙计，这些家伙看起来真的很酷，他们超级聪明。

I feel like  I'll learn a lot of stuff from them.

我觉得我会从他们身上学到很多东西。

Man, how do I get on their  bandwagon?" I'm thinking about quitting YCs.

伙计，我怎么才能赶上他们的潮流？“我在考虑退出YCs。

That would be like the best ones possible.

这将是最好的可能。

In  the second tier, it's really just like I'm energized, because when I'm reading tons of  applications I just don't understand what's going on or I feel like people wasted a  lot of time on the wrong stuff.

在第二层，我真的很有活力，因为当我阅读大量的应用程序时，我就是不明白发生了什么，或者我觉得人们在错误的东西上浪费了很多时间。

I'm just getting frustrated.

我只是有点沮丧。

When I hit an  application where all of a sudden it goes like, oh, it's a breath of fresh  air and I like I want to spend time with them.

当我点击一个应用程序时，它突然变得像，哦，这是一股新鲜空气，我喜欢我想花时间和他们在一起。

I want to ask  them a bunch of questions.

我想问他们一堆问题。

I get very curious, and then I want to jump  around the room.

我很好奇，然后我想在房间里跳来跳去。

I'm a very active guy, so I think if Adora got excited,  she'd drink a glass of water, something like that.

我是一个非常活跃的人，所以我想如果阿多拉兴奋起来，她会喝一杯水，诸如此类。

Really, the best ones are the  ones that makes us wish we had done the company or that we would join  them.

真的，最好的是那些让我们希望我们做了公司或者我们会加入他们的公司。

That's the best.

这是最好的。

Right here.
Speaker 6:If the why or the how are very important for the idea, how can you  include them?
Kevin:How can I what?
Speaker 6:Include them.
Kevin:Oh, okay.

就在这儿。演讲者6：如果“为什么”或“如何”对这个想法非常重要，你怎么能把它们包括进来呢？凯文：我怎么能什么？演讲者6：包括他们。凯文：哦，好吧。

I talk a lot about focusing on the what and then avoid the  how and the why, but they might be really important.

我说了很多关于关注什么，然后避免如何和为什么，但它们可能真的很重要。

How do I include them?  You will not include them in the description.

如何包含它们？您将不会将它们包括在说明中。

They will be included elsewhere.

它们将被包括在其他地方。

There's questions  on the application that ask you about how are you going to get your users,  what is the insight that you understand the business that no one else does, how  you came across this, et cetera.

应用程序上有一些问题，询问您如何获得用户，您对业务的了解是什么，其他人都不了解，您是如何遇到这些问题的，等等。

There's opportunities elsewhere.

其他地方也有机会。

The one thing to keep in  mind is I would highly recommend trying to keep your answers within one to two  paragraphs, at the most.

要记住的一件事是我强烈建议尽量把你的答案保持在一到两段之内，最多。

That makes for an application that's very skimable by me.

这就形成了一个我非常容易浏览的应用程序。

The  whole thing is the how and why is important, but you can't just say it  all at once.

整个事情是如何和为什么是重要的，但你不能一下子说完。

Sometimes you talk to someone and they're telling you a story but  they're trying to tell everything about everything all at once.

有时你和某人交谈，他们在给你讲故事，但他们试图一次把所有的事情都告诉你。

It feels like it's not  giving you time to breathe or think.

感觉它没有给你呼吸或思考的时间。

You want to avoid that context.

你想避免这种情况。

Right over  there.

就在那边。

Enthusiastic curly hair.
Speaker 7:How do you know a company's on the right track on getting a product market  fit?
Kevin:How? That sounds like a together question, but I'll answer it.

热情的卷发。演讲者7：你怎么知道一家公司在产品市场上走上了正确的轨道？怎样？这听起来像是一个共同的问题，但我会回答的。

How do you know  if a company's on the right path to product market fit? If you have to  ask a question, "Do I have product market fit?" The answer is probably no, you  probably don't.

如何知道一家公司是否走上了适合产品市场的正确道路？如果你不得不问一个问题，“我的产品适合市场吗？”答案可能是不，你可能不知道。

But if you're so busy and you're frightened that the company's going to  fall apart because you have so many customers coming in asking stuff from you, and  you're just figuring out how do I hire? How do I serve everyone that wants  to come to me? You're too busy to ask that question because you're just making  money hand over fist.

但是，如果你这么忙，你害怕公司会崩溃，因为你有这么多客户来问你问题，而你只是想知道我该如何招聘呢？我如何为每个想来找我的人服务？你太忙了，没时间问这个问题，因为你只是在手忙脚乱地赚钱。

That's product market fit.

这就是产品市场的契合度。

You're on the right path.

你在正确的道路上。

The whole  thing is it feels like something else.

整件事就是感觉像是别的什么东西。

Change in the company.

公司的变化。

It feels like you're  out of control.

感觉你失控了。

If you are in control of your company, you feel like you  can relax and you're sleeping well, you're not on the right track.

如果你在控制你的公司，你会觉得你可以放松，你睡得很好，你没有走上正确的轨道。

Very few companies  ever experience this.

很少有公司经历过这种情况。

Far back.
Speaker 8:Okay.

很久以前。扬声器8：好的。

Well, this is just if you can talk about your experience doing this because  right now if you're on the other side of the stories where you can go  back to when you were applying to Y Combinator and [inaudible] this and making this  exciting.
Kevin:I'll tell a small anecdote about when I applied to YC and about how this  sort of applies.

嗯，这只是如果你可以谈论你做这件事的经历，因为现在如果你在故事的另一边，你可以回到你申请Y Combinator的时候，[听不见]这个，让这个令人兴奋。凯文：我会讲一个小轶事，关于我申请YC的时间，以及这种方式是如何适用的。

When I applied to Y Combinator I was really bad at describing  what our company does, so we actually had pitched two different ideas.

当我申请Y Combinator时，我真的很不擅长描述我们公司的业务，所以我们实际上提出了两个不同的想法。

They told us  to prepare for both, and when we got into the interview, one of the ideas  they immediately said, "Not interested," and the other idea we ended up pivoting in the  middle of the interview.

他们告诉我们两个都要准备，当我们进入面试时，其中一个想法他们立即说，“不感兴趣”，而另一个想法，我们最终在面试中途转身了。

The way I had described the company in the beginning was  I said, "We are building a content-management system that has a concept called reversible forms  that allows you to both put data input in from the back end and also  collect data from users on the front end." That's a horrible description of a company.

我在一开始描述公司的方式是，“我们正在构建一个内容管理系统，它有一个称为可逆表单的概念，它允许您既可以从后端输入数据，也可以从前端的用户那里收集数据。”这是对一家公司的可怕描述。

 Part of that idea that fed that is like I wanted to be a content-management  system because what was hot at the time, or was buzz, where it was Movable  Type and Wordpress.

FED的一部分想法就像我想成为一个内容管理系统，因为当时什么是热门的，或者是嗡嗡的，那里是Modible Type和Wordpress。

We wanted to build software like that and we wanted to build  a new version of this.

我们想要建立这样的软件，我们想要建立一个新版本的这个。

I added, not even normal jargon, a made-up jargon that  I put into my description and I pitched it.

我添加了，甚至不是普通的行话，一个虚构的行话，我把它放进了我的描述中，然后我把它投放到我的描述中。

Paul Graham was just like, "I  don't know what you're talking about," but he was like, "I think you're building a  form builder." We were like, "No! No!" We looked at everyone in that space.

保罗·格雷厄姆就像是，“我不知道你在说什么，”但他说，“我认为你在构建一个表单构建器。”我们就像，“不！”我们看了那个空间里的每个人。

They  sucked.

他们糟透了。

They're really bad.

他们真的很糟糕。

We don't like what they're making.

我们不喜欢他们做的东西。

We don't want to be  there, not realizing that was the opportunity.

我们不想去那里，没有意识到那是一个机会。

Everyone was really bad there, but there were  businesses that still succeeded.

那里的每个人都很糟糕，但仍有一些企业取得了成功。

That's the clear example of this from the other side.

这是另一边的一个明显的例子。

I  actually spent a lot of times, Adora and I spent a lot of times, fixing  mentally in our heads what you guys are making or doing.

实际上，我花了很多时间，阿多拉和我花了很多时间，在我们的头脑中确定你们正在做什么或在做什么。

Actually, after we're reading  applications, a lot of times, partners have to basically re-describe or re-pitch back what you're  making so that way they can understand why they're going to get excited.

实际上，在我们阅读应用程序之后，很多时候，合作伙伴必须基本上重新描述或重新投放回你正在制作的东西，这样他们就可以理解为什么他们会感到兴奋。

I'm going  to do one more question and then we're going to do a combo.

我要再问一个问题，然后我们要做一个组合。

Right here.
Speaker 9:Hello.

就在这儿。扬声器9：你好。

How do you tell an idea that has multiple stages? For instance, if you  want to become Z but before that, you need to do X and Y?
Kevin:How do you tell and describe an idea that has multiple stages, like you have  to do part one before you can do part two and three.

如何分辨一个有多个阶段的想法？例如，如果你想成为Z，但在那之前，你需要做X和Y？凯文：你如何告诉和描述一个有多个阶段的想法，就像你必须先做第一部分，然后才能做第二部分和第三部分。

I would focus  only on describing what part one is, and then later on, you talk about what  are the other phases that are important.

我只会专注于描述第一部分是什么，然后，您将讨论其他重要的阶段是什么。

Oftentimes when I hear something like that, a  YC partner will immediately have an alarm go in their head and they really are  going to push you on why do we really have to do part one? I'm  going to push so hard on why can't we go straight to part three, because  what you're basically saying is it sounds almost like a defense instead of you saying  your strategy.

通常，当我听到类似的事情时，YC合作伙伴会立即在他们的脑海中发出警报，他们真的会催促你为什么我们真的要做第一部分？我将如此努力地推动为什么我们不能直接进入第三部分，因为你基本上是说这听起来像是一种辩护，而不是你说你的策略。

It sounds like it's, "Hey, I'm going to talk about what my company's  doing but I'm worried that you're going to think it's really small, so don't worry.

这听起来像是，“嘿，我要谈谈我的公司在做什么，但我担心你会认为它真的很小，所以别担心。

 We're going to do parts two and three.

我们要做第二部分和第三部分。

They're going to be even bigger." The  thing is, that's a really weak pitch.

他们会变得更大。“问题是，这是一个非常弱的投球。

It doesn't sound very confident, et cetera.

听起来不是很自信，等等。

What  you want to avoid is saying, "We're doing number..." What you could do is, "We're  doing number three and we're starting with number one." That has to be very efficient,  that number three is very quickly can be said and that number one makes its  sense.

你要避免的是说，“我们在做数字.”你可以做的是，“我们在做第三个，我们从第一个开始。”这必须是非常有效的，第三个数字很快就可以说出来，第一个数字是有意义的。

It's like I want to build automated market...

就像我想建立自动化市场.。

I just met a [inaudible] company  today and they want to make automated marketing software for WhatsApp for small meeting businesses.

我今天刚遇到一家[听不见的]公司，他们想为WhatsApp制作自动营销软件，用于小型会议企业。

 They're starting with hair salons, then they're going to move on to all the other  industries that need help with that.

他们从美发沙龙开始，然后他们将转向所有其他需要帮助的行业。

All right.

好的。

Thank you very much.

非常感谢。

I'm going to  invite Adora to come on.


我要邀请阿多拉来。
