# Kevin Hale - Startup Pricing 101

Kevin Hale:This was a highly requested talk from last year.

凯文·黑尔：这是去年要求很高的一次演讲。

Lots of people who had questions  about pricing were really confused.

很多对定价有疑问的人真的很困惑。

It actually was well requested both at YC itself, that's  a very, very popular workshop that we run.

这实际上是YC本身都很好地要求的，那是我们经营的一个非常受欢迎的研讨会。

And so we're going to go over  a lot of basic fundamentals for pricing that hopefully will just help you understand how  to approach your pricing and monetization from first principles, and then you help you help  yourselves.

因此，我们将复习许多定价的基本原理，希望这些基本原理将帮助您了解如何从第一原则开始进行定价和货币化，然后您可以自己动手。

Same thing with the landing page.

登陆页面也一样。

So we're going to go over first principles  for pricing.

所以我们要回顾一下定价的基本原则。

We're going to go over why is pricing particularly hard for startups, for  people making innovative products and new markets? Like why is it extra difficult? How do  you do price optimization? Like how do you actually do it? What does that actually  look like? And just kind of demystify that whole process.

我们将讨论为什么对初创企业，对那些创造创新产品和新市场的人来说，定价特别困难？比如为什么特别难？如何进行价格优化？比如你到底是怎么做的？那实际上看起来像什么？并且在某种程度上揭开了整个过程的神秘面纱。

When we look at the  challenges of pricing, you start recognizing why certain types of customer segments that you're going  after are difficult, like SMB.

当我们看到定价的挑战时，您开始认识到为什么您要追逐的某些类型的客户细分很困难，例如SMB。

And we'll talk a little bit about that.

我们会稍微谈一谈这一点。

We're going  to talk about how pricing affects your acquisition strategy.

我们将讨论定价如何影响您的收购策略。

It changes what you can do  and what you cannot do and it's extremely important because a lot of companies get  caught up doing the wrong acquisition strategy or wasting too much money because their price  is incorrect.

它改变了你能做什么，你不能做什么，这是极其重要的，因为很多公司会因为价格不正确而陷入错误的收购战略或浪费太多的钱。

And then I'm going to give you some rules of thumbs, some pricing  tricks, just to help make it a lot easier when you're encountering different pricing problems.

然后我会给你一些经验法则，一些定价技巧，只是为了帮助你在遇到不同的定价问题时容易得多。

 I call them pricing tricks sprinkles.

我称之为定价技巧。

Okay.

好吧。

There are three levers you can pull to  improve growth.

有三个杠杆你可以拉来促进生长。

So in the last talk I talked about conversion rate and churn, but  monetization is actually the big dog.

所以在上一次演讲中，我谈到了转换率和流动率，但货币化实际上是大狗。

It's the one that I really like.

这是我真正喜欢的。

Now, there  was a survey done with over 500 SaaS companies and they talked about sort of  like amount of effort that they put into each one of these strategies and the  returns that they got as a result of it.

现在，有一项对500多家SaaS公司进行的调查，他们谈到了他们在每个战略上投入的努力以及由此获得的回报。

Now acquisition is really fun and  exciting.

现在收购真的很有趣和令人兴奋。

It's the one that everyone kind of understands simply.

这是一个每个人都能简单理解的东西。

It's like, "I get more  customers, I get more logos, gives me more growth." Retention of course is about keeping  customers, and monetization is about getting more money per customer.

这就像是，“我得到了更多的客户，我得到了更多的标志，给了我更多的增长。”留住客户当然是为了留住客户，而货币化则是为了让每个客户获得更多的钱。

Now if you increase just  your efforts or resources by 1%, your work on acquisition usually get a return of  about 3.32%.

现在，如果你只增加你的努力或资源1%，你的收购工作通常会得到大约3.32%的回报。

In retention it's about 6.7 and when you're optimizing pricing that gives you  your biggest bang for your buck in terms of impact on your business.

在保留率方面，大约为6.7，当您正在优化定价时，就对业务的影响而言，这会给您带来最大的性价比。

Yet and  it's the one that is most neglected and I think it's the one that everyone  is so afraid to touch because they're so scared that if they get the pricing  wrong that they will lose all their customers.

然而，它是最被忽视的一个，我认为它是每个人都不敢碰的，因为他们太害怕了，如果他们定价错误，他们会失去所有的客户。

Now the first principles, the basic idea  about pricing, the thing, the concept that really opened up in my head, how to  think about pricing, how to understand the problems that people are facing and why startups  get it wrong, is to use a concept called the pricing thermometer.

现在，第一个原则，关于定价的基本思想，这个东西，我脑海中真正开启的概念，如何思考定价，如何理解人们面临的问题，以及为什么初创企业会出错，是使用一个叫做定价温度计的概念。

And so you  have to understand that when you price something there's actually two other factors at play.

所以你必须明白，当你给某样东西定价时，实际上还有另外两个因素在起作用。

 And so there's a cost, there's the price and then there's the value.

所以有成本，有价格，然后有价值。

And the  interplay and relationship between these items affects how growth happens inside of your company.

这些项目之间的相互作用和关系会影响公司内部的发展。

Now  the gap between price and cost, that is your margin, that is your incentive to  sell.

现在价格和成本之间的差距，那是你的利润，那是你出售的动机。

And so the bigger that gap is, the more you are driven to want  to push your product to your customers, to have your salespeople, et cetera.

因此，差距越大，你就越想把你的产品推向你的客户，让你的销售人员等等。

This gap  here between price and value, is incentive to buy.

这里的价格和价值之间的差距，是购买的动机。

And the larger that gap is,  the easier it is to have your customers to want to sign up or use  your product.

而且差距越大，就越容易让您的客户想要注册或使用您的产品。

Now to figure out price, there's really two ways to go about it.

现在要计算价格，实际上有两种方法。

 You either start with the cost if you know what it is and you figure  out where your price is based off of that.

你要么从成本开始，如果你知道它是什么，并找出你的价格是基于这一点。

That is called cost plus.

这就是所谓的成本加成。

The  other way to do it is figure out what is the value of your company  or product or service and then you figure out your price from that and that  is called value based pricing.

另一种方法是找出你的公司或产品或服务的价值，然后你从中计算出你的价格，这就是所谓的基于价值的定价。

In startups and almost pretty consistently across all businesses, everyone  will tell you, you should strive for value-based pricing.

在初创企业中，几乎所有企业都非常一致，每个人都会告诉你，你应该努力实现基于价值的定价。

It allows you to charge a  whole lot more.

它允许你收取更多的费用。

It allows you to manipulate this incentive to buy.

它允许你操纵这种购买动机。

The problem is  because people do not understand their relationships or even understand what are their costs and  what are the value that the customer is going to think about their product, they  put their price in a kind of arbitrary place and they don't know what are  the forces at play that drives it.

问题是因为人们不了解他们的关系，甚至不知道他们的成本是什么，以及客户会考虑他们的产品的价值是什么，他们把他们的价格放在一种随意的地方，他们不知道是什么力量在起作用，推动他们的价格。

And it results in four different types of  mistakes.

它导致了四种不同类型的错误。

The first one is startups will price their products too low.

第一个是初创企业会将他们的产品定价过低。

Basically you consistently  undercharge.

基本上你总是少收费。

It's the number one piece of advice we give to most startups, to fix  their pricing.

这是我们给大多数初创企业的头号建议，解决它们的定价问题。

And I'll talk a little bit about why most companies fall into that  trap.

我将略微谈一谈为什么大多数公司会落入这个陷阱。

You underestimate your costs, and the result is you have a problem where your  margins aren't enough to cover sort of acquisition.

你低估了你的成本，结果是你遇到了一个问题，你的利润率不足以支付某种收购。

You don't understand your value.

你不明白自己的价值。

You don't  understand how your company thinks about the problem that you're solving for them or how  they value it.

你不明白你的公司是如何看待你为他们解决的问题，或者他们是如何看待这个问题的。

And either they don't understand your value or you don't know how  to convince them of the value that you think you offer.

要么他们不理解你的价值，要么你不知道如何让他们相信你认为你提供的价值。

And as a result  you can't get the price that you want.

结果，你不能得到你想要的价格。

And lastly you focus on the wrong  customers.

最后，你把注意力放在了错误的客户身上。

That you think, "Man, if I built a better product and I charge half  the competition, I win." The thing is that almost never happens, and the reason is  because you as a startup, you as working on something to create a new market  are working on innovative products.

你认为，“伙计，如果我制造了一个更好的产品，我收取一半的竞争费用，我就赢了。”事情是这样的，几乎从来没有发生过，原因是你作为一家初创公司，你正在致力于创造一个新的市场，你正在致力于创新产品。

You are focused on the wrong customers.

你关注的是错误的客户。

They are not  the mainstream people who are going to look at the price and make most of  the determination based off of that.

他们不是主流的人，他们会考虑价格，并在此基础上做出大部分的决定。

This is the sales and profit over a product's  life from inception to demise, that's what it's called.

这是一个产品从诞生到消亡的整个生命周期中的销售额和利润，这就是它的名字。

All you need to know is  that these are five different stages of a company and this is what sales might  look like over different stages and what profits might look like over those different stages.

所有你需要知道的是，这是一个公司的五个不同阶段，这就是不同阶段的销售情况，以及不同阶段的利润情况。

 You who are in startup school, you who are getting seed funding, you are in  the first two stages, product development stage, introduction.

你是初创学校的学生，你是获得种子资金的人，你处于前两个阶段，产品开发阶段，介绍阶段。

You are not in the growth phase.

你不是在成长阶段。

 And the thing to keep in mind is that the customers in the first two  stages, the ones that you're going after, they don't look like mainstream customers that you  find in growth and maturity stages.

需要记住的是，前两个阶段的客户，你要追求的那些，他们看起来不像你在成长和成熟阶段找到的主流客户。

They're not mature customers, they're early adopters.

他们不是成熟的客户，他们是早期采用者。

And thing  to know about early adopters is you don't really get a lot of momentum and  growth until you get past the first two to 5% of potential buyers of your  market.

关于早期采用者需要知道的是，在你通过市场的前2%到5%的潜在买家之前，你不会真的获得很大的动力和增长。

These people in that two to 5%, they're called early adopters.

这些人占2%到5%，他们被称为早期采用者。

And a thing  that drives them is very different from mainstream people.

驱使他们的东西与主流人有很大的不同。

So one, there's a couple of  things that keep in mind about pricing innovative products.

首先，关于创新产品的定价，有几件事要牢记在心。

What you are trying to do  fundamentally is require users to change their pattern.

你试图从根本上做的是要求用户改变他们的模式。

To stop doing it the old shitty  spreadsheet way and do it in the new better your way.

停止用旧的糟糕的电子表格方式，用新的更好的方式来做。

And getting someone to  change their pattern is actually difficult.

让某人改变他们的模式实际上是困难的。

Right? Especially if they're a mature person.

对吗？特别是如果他们是个成熟的人。

Partly because  the average user lacks information needed and the trust in you or whatever it is  that you're making to make that change, to take that risk.

部分原因是普通用户缺乏所需的信息和对你的信任，或者是你做出改变、承担风险的任何东西。

You are entrepreneurs, you're  comfortable taking risks.

你们是企业家，你们乐于承担风险。

Your customers are not entrepreneurs for the most part, they're probably less  comfortable taking risks.

你的客户在很大程度上不是企业家，他们可能不太愿意冒险。

And so in the beginning you're going after people who are willing  to take a risk, and those are early adopters.

所以在一开始，你要找的是那些愿意冒险的人，而这些人都是早期的采用者。

Those are people who care about  benefits above all else.

这些人关心的是利益高于一切。

That the highest value to them is beating their competition, doing  something much better and taking a chance that something new will give them that edge  over anybody else.

对他们来说，最高的价值是击败他们的竞争对手，做得更好，并抓住机会，让新的东西给他们带来优于任何人的优势。

Those early adopters therefore are not price sensitive.

因此，这些早期采用者对价格并不敏感。

If anything, if you've  built a better product and you charge less, it looks like you have reputation risk.

如果有什么，如果你已经建立了一个更好的产品，你收费较低，看起来你有声誉风险。

 It's like why is it too good to be true? What is the catch? And  what will end up happening is it takes much longer to get them to understand.

就像为什么这件事好得不像是真的？陷阱是什么？最终会发生的是需要更长的时间才能让他们理解。

 This is basically all price optimization.

这基本上都是价格优化。

This is those complicated way that you can try  to show price optimization.

这是那些复杂的方式，你可以尝试显示价格优化。

This is the demand yield curve, and what you have on  this side is different prices, and on this side you have sales unit sales and  basically what you are trying to figure out when you're optimizing the price that you're  charging your customers is like, "Basically what is the perfect balance between how much I  charge and how much sales volume I get?" And then your price optimization is basically  that.

这是需求收益曲线，你在这一边有不同的价格，在这一边你有销售单位销售，基本上你试图找出当你优化你向客户收费的价格时，“基本上，我收取的费用和我得到的销售量之间的完美平衡是什么？”然后你的价格优化基本上就是。

Try different prices and then see what the effect is.

尝试不同的价格，然后看看效果如何。

When I have my  companies optimize their prices, they just use a very simple table.

当我让我的公司优化他们的价格时，他们只使用一个非常简单的表格。

You don't need to  try to figure that weird-ass graph.

你不需要试着去画那个奇怪的屁股图。

Basically you want to have a column that says  these are the prices I'm going to try, and then what is the result in  conversion rate, what is the result in sales volume? And then how much revenue did  I generate? That's all it is.

基本上，你想要有一个专栏，说这些是我要尝试的价格，然后换算率的结果是什么，销售量的结果是什么？然后我产生了多少收入？仅此而已。

And so let's say I have prices at these  different price points and I get these different conversion rates, and I get this sales  volume, I should immediately be able to see who the winner is.

假设我有这些不同价格点的价格，我得到这些不同的转换率，我得到这个销售量，我应该马上就能看到谁是赢家。

Here we go.

我们开始吧。

 Now, the one thing to keep in mind once we have figured out something like  this on a simple product is that these areas at lower prices, if you can  afford them in terms of your margin are actually lost opportunities.

现在，一旦我们在一个简单的产品上找到了类似的东西，需要记住的一件事是，这些价格较低的区域，如果你能负担得起你的利润率，实际上是失去了机会。

And what you want  to understand about these, are these are what you're going to see if you offer  discount pricing or offer tiered pricing at different price points.

关于这些，你想要了解的是，如果你提供折扣定价或在不同价格点提供分层定价，你将会看到这些。

Another exercise I like to  go with companies when dealing with pricing is help them understand like are you in  a danger zone? And so what I usually do with my companies is I have  them sort of calculate what would their business look like or what does it going  to look like to be a billion-dollar company.

在处理定价问题时，我喜欢与公司一起进行的另一个练习是帮助他们理解，比如你是否处于危险区域？所以我通常对我的公司做的是，我让他们计算一下他们的业务会是什么样子，或者是一个十亿美元的公司会是什么样子。

And usually the rule of thumb there  is to be doing $100 million a year in sales and revenue.

通常情况下，经验法则是每年销售和收入达到1亿美元。

And so that  basically is like at your price that you give, how many customers do you need  to have to make a $100 million in that year? So let's have a bunch  of different price points.

所以基本上就像你给的价格，你需要多少客户才能在那一年赚到1亿美元？所以让我们有一堆不同的价格点。

Then we know, "Okay, great.

然后我们就知道，“好的，太好了。

I need these number of customers  in order to make this formula work." You understand what that looks like, at a  hundred-dollar price point, with a potential of about million users, right? This is consumers.

我需要这些数量的客户来使这个公式起作用。“你知道在100美元的价格点上看起来是什么样子，有大约100万用户的潜力，对吧？这就是消费者。

That's  what that consumer space looks like.

这就是消费空间的样子。

And you know what this down here it looks  like.

你知道这下面是什么样子的。

$100,000 here, we call this enterprise.

在这里，我们称这个企业为10万美元。

This area here is the part that a  lot of companies are in and really, really struggle.

这一领域是很多公司所处的领域，而且真的，真的很挣扎。

They're on the struggle bus and  it tends to be SMB.

他们在斗争公交车上，而且往往是SMB。

These are people who treat their money like consumers, but  they look like they might be an enterprise.

这些人像对待消费者一样对待他们的钱，但他们看起来可能是一个企业。

And the reason why this is such  a danger zone is because it will tend to fit in the wrong place on  my next diagram.

之所以这是一个危险区域，是因为它会倾向于在我的下一个图表上放在错误的位置。

So let's imagine that this vertical axis represents price.

让我们假设这个垂直轴代表价格。

You can charge  either a high price or a low price for your product and this represents complexity  of your sales process.

你可以为你的产品收取高价或低价，这代表了你的销售过程的复杂性。

Low complexity to high complexity.

从低复杂度到高复杂度。

If you are having a product  that is $2,000 or less and is basically self-serve, then you have something in this  quadrant here.

如果你有一个2000美元或更少的产品，并且基本上是自助服务，那么你在这个象限中有一些东西。

And this affects completely what you can do in terms of what drives  your business, what you can spend on to get that sort of growth, that price  point here at $2,000.

这完全影响了你可以做什么，你可以做什么来推动你的业务，你可以花多少钱来获得这样的增长，这里的价格点是2，000美元。

It needs to have almost all marketing be inbound.

它需要几乎所有的营销都是内向的。

You can't  spend a lot of money outbound on ads, et cetera.

你不能在广告上花很多钱，等等。

Your support has to be  completely self-serve or very, very minimal.

你的支持必须是完全自助式的，或者是非常少的。

You have no sales team at this price point.

在这个价位上，您没有销售团队。

 You can't afford it.

你买不起。

But conversions can happen on the same day, must be in  a self-serve model.

但是转换可以在同一天发生，必须在自助模式下进行。

Transactional, so between two and $10,000 when you're able to charge this,  you're able to have a few new toys at your sleeves and so marketing now  can be focused on generating qualified leads.

交易，所以当你能够充电时，你可以在2到10，000美元之间，你可以有一些新的玩具在你的袖子里，所以营销现在可以专注于产生合格的线索。

Your customer support can now offer SLAs or  you could start paying for training [inaudible] people get onboarded.

您的客户支持现在可以提供SLA，或者您可以开始为培训[听不见]人员支付入职费用。

For sales, you can't hire  a dedicated salesperson, but maybe you could have an inside sales rep to sell within  companies or within your customers.

对于销售，你不能雇佣专职的销售人员，但也许你可以有一个内部销售代表在公司或客户内部销售。

You could maybe have an SDR and you can maybe  have someone dedicated to giving product demos.

你可能有一个特别提款权，你可能会有一个人致力于提供产品演示。

Sales cycle here should not be longer than  one to three months.

这里的销售周期不应该超过一到三个月。

Enterprise, so over $25,000.

企业，所以超过25，000美元。

Now for marketing, you can start spending  things on branding, on building up trust with customers.

现在对于市场营销，你可以开始在品牌上花钱，建立与客户的信任。

Your support is very, very high  touch that you can afford.

你的支持是你能负担得起的非常高的触觉。

You can do phone support, you can have a customer  success person dedicated to the client.

你可以做电话支持，你可以有一个客户成功人士专门为客户。

And for sales, you're going to start thinking about  sales managers, dividing stuff into territories and having sales engineers that participate in terms of  conversion and the sales calls.

对于销售，你将开始考虑销售经理，将员工划分为不同的区域，并让销售工程师参与转换和销售电话。

These will have a sales cycle of about six to  12 months.

这些产品的销售周期约为6至12个月。

This is the garbage zone, right? And you know, if you're potentially in  this, and this is the big wake up call for you, if it's taking you  months and months and months to close someone, but you're not making a lot of  money to cover it, you have a process where your acquisition costs are just too  high for you to be sustainable and you have to get yourself out of that  problem.

这是垃圾区对吧？你知道，如果你有潜在的机会，这对你来说是一个很大的警钟，如果你花了几个月的时间来关闭某人，但你赚不到很多钱来支付它，你的收购成本太高了，你无法持续下去，你必须让自己摆脱这个问题。

All of your work should be towards increasing the perceived value of your product  or service.

你所有的工作都应该是为了增加你的产品或服务的感知价值。

I'm going to end on a good rule of thumb.

我将以一个很好的经验法则结束。

So if you  are starting with some kind of price but you don't know how to sort of  optimize it or figure it out, then here's a good place to get going.

所以，如果你从某种价格开始，但你不知道如何优化它或弄清楚它，那么这里是一个很好的地方。

The  first thing is, I like to have things where the value is 10X the price  of whatever it is I'm charging.

第一件事是，我喜欢价值是我所收取的任何价格的10倍的东西。

And I want to have it so that the  value is easily understood to be a 10X.

我想拥有它，这样这个值就很容易理解为10X。

So for example, if I charge for  a product that is $10, then it should be in terms of perceived value by  my customer that it's worth $100 to them.

因此，例如，如果我对一个10美元的产品收费，那么它应该是我的客户的感知价值，它对他们来说价值100美元。

If they do not immediately understand the  10X value of the price, it's going to be hard to get them to move.

如果他们不立即了解价格的10倍价值，就很难让他们搬家。

 Their incentive to buy might be too low.

他们的购买动机可能太低了。

Once you have any kind of price,  and this is particularly important for people who are doing B2B or enterprise sale, you  should start practicing raising prices.

一旦你有了任何一种价格，这对于做B2B或企业销售的人来说尤其重要，你应该开始练习提高价格。

And I like to just start by raising prices by  5%.

我喜欢先把价格提高5%。

If you feel really confident, jump it up by bigger numbers if you want,  but this is a pretty safe way to do it so that you can feel  comfortable with it.

如果你真的感到自信，如果你愿意的话，可以增加更多的数字，但是这是一个非常安全的方法，这样你就可以感觉很舒服了。

And you want to keep raising prices until you're losing 20% of  your customers.

你想不断提高价格，直到你失去了20%的客户。

That's about a good balance to have in terms of understanding that like,  "I have a good price here.

这是一个很好的平衡，就像“我在这里有一个很好的价格”这样的理解。

I'm losing 20% of my deals.

我失去了20%的交易。

It's not too  high, it's not too low." In summary for pricing.

它不是太高，也不是太低。

Pricing gives the most bang for  your buck.

定价给你的钱带来最大的冲击。

You should work on pricing.

你应该在定价上下功夫。

If you've never touched the pricing of your  product, then you're losing out on lots of potential growth.

如果你从未接触过你的产品的定价，那么你将失去很多潜在的增长。

Understand the variables.

了解变量。

Do you  really understand your cost? Do you understand why you've played the price where it is,  and do you understand the value? When you go into a sales meeting or a  call, do you talk to people or you basically say, "I know exactly what this  is going to be worth to you." So when I tell you what the price  is going to be, you're going to be like, "Damn, that's totally worth it." Go  after early adopters.

你真的明白你的代价吗？你知道为什么你要在这个价格上下注吗？你知道它的价值吗？当你参加销售会议或电话时，你是和别人交谈还是基本上说，“我确切地知道这对你来说有多大价值。”所以当我告诉你价格是多少时，你会说，“该死，这完全值得。”追查早期采用者。

Remember as a startup, that is who you're going after.

记住，作为一家初创企业，这就是你要追求的人。

So when  you are talking to customers and they are taking a really long time to make  a decision, or they're wanting to have a lot more proof that other people are  using it, you are not talking to an early adopter.

因此，当你与客户交谈时，他们需要很长时间才能做出决定，或者他们想要有更多证据证明其他人正在使用它，你并不是在和早期采用者交谈。

You're wasting a lot of  time on non-believers.

你在不信教的人身上浪费了很多时间。

Go after them first.

先去追他们。

Don't take it personally when these people who  are much more mature aren't ready for your product.

当这些成熟得多的人还没有准备好接受你的产品时，不要认为这是针对个人的。

They were never going to be.

他们永远都不会是。

 Your job is to get through that first two to 5% of the market.

你的工作是通过前2%到5%的市场份额。

Those  early adopters care more about benefits than price, so don't undercharge your products when you  have something that is of value and easily understood to have value.

那些早期采用者更关心的是利益而不是价格，所以当你拥有价值的东西并且很容易被理解为有价值时，不要低估你的产品。

Get organized.

组织起来。

When  you're doing price optimization, it's really, really easy.

当你在做价格优化的时候，它真的，真的很容易。

Don't over complicate things.

别把事情搞得太复杂了。

Figure out a  bunch of different price points you want to check, understand sales volume, conversion rate, and  the revenue that's involved, and that will help you make the best pricing decision.

找出一堆你想要检查的不同价格点，了解销售量，转化率和涉及的收入，这将帮助你做出最好的定价决策。

Your  price will determine your acquisition strategy.

你的价格将决定你的收购策略。

If you realize that your sales cycle or all  the things that you're spending on is way too much for the amount of money  that you're charging, you either need to increase the price, [inaudible] reduce your acquisition strategy  costs.

如果你意识到你的销售周期或你所花费的所有东西对于你所收取的钱来说太多了，你要么需要提高价格，[听不见]降低你的收购战略成本。

Use the 10/5/20 rule.

使用10/5/20规则。

Set a price that is 10X, that has a 10th  of the value.

将价格设置为10X，即价值的十分之一。

Increased prices by 5% until you're losing 20% of the deals.

将价格提高5%，直到你失去20%的交易。

Thank  you very much guys.


非常感谢你们。
