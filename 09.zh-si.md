# Kirsty Nathoo - Startup Finance Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

Kirsty Nathoo:Morning, everybody.

Kirsty Nathoo：大家早上好。

Thank you for coming in at 9:00.

谢谢你9点过来。

It's an early start.

这是个很早的开始。

As Kevin  mentioned, my name is Kirsty Nathoo, and I'm the CFO here at Y Combinator.

正如Kevin提到的，我的名字是Kirsty Nathoo，我是Y Combinator的首席财务官。

So  I've actually helped now 2000 companies almost, as they've come through Y Combinator.

所以我实际上已经帮助了几乎2000家公司，因为他们已经通过Y Combinator来了。

Seen a  lot of successes and seen a lot of failures.

看到了很多成功，也看到了很多失败。

I'm going to help you just  understand some of the big mistakes that we see some of these companies doing based  on their cash, and based on their money.

我将帮助你们理解一些我们看到的基于现金和资金的公司犯下的一些大错误。

For every business, whether it's a startup  or a mom-and-pop shop, cash is its lifeblood.

对于每一家企业，无论是初创企业还是夫妻店，现金都是它的命脉。

If you run out of cash, then  the business dies.

如果你的现金用完了，那么生意就完蛋了。

There's really no going back at that point.

在这一点上真的没有回头路可走了。

It's actually surprisingly easy  to run out of cash.

实际上，现金很容易就会用完。

We see many startups not realize that they have done  that until it's too late to actually be able to turn it round and do  something about it.

我们看到许多初创公司没有意识到他们已经做到了这一点，直到现在已经太晚，无法真正扭转局面，并对此做点什么。

We're going to talk about these three early stage pitfalls.

我们将讨论这三个早期阶段的陷阱。

This is  probably most relevant to you right now.

这可能是目前与你最相关的。

Then we'll talk through another three that, as  you start to raise money and are starting to think about hiring, some of the  other mistakes that companies make.

然后，我们将讨论另外三个问题，当你开始筹集资金并开始考虑招聘时，公司会犯下其他一些错误。

We're going to look at what the numbers you should  be looking at, how often you should be looking at them, whether your expenses are  realistic, and then thinking a little bit more about hiring and looking at responsibilities.

我们将看看你应该看什么数字，你应该多久看一次这些数字，你的支出是否现实，然后再考虑一下招聘和责任方面的更多问题。

All  right, so let's move on to the first one.

好的，让我们转到第一个。

The first mistake is really not  knowing what numbers to look at to make sure that the health of your company  is good.

第一个错误是真的不知道要查看哪些数字才能确保公司的健康状况良好。

Really, there are three things that you should know, your bank balance, the  money coming in, and the money going out.

真的，有三件事你应该知道，你的银行余额，资金流入和资金流出。

These are not difficult.

这些并不困难。

You don't need  anything fancy to be able to do this.

你不需要任何花哨的东西就能做到这一点。

This is all information you can get  from your online banking or your bank statements.

这是您可以从您的网上银行或银行对账单中获得的所有信息。

You don't need bookkeepers, you don't need  financial software.

你不需要簿记员，你不需要财务软件。

This is super straightforward, but you would be amazed at how many companies  don't look at this.

这非常简单，但你会惊讶于有多少公司不关注这一点。

Then using these three numbers, you can then calculate some other  things.

然后使用这三个数字，你可以计算一些其他的东西。

You can look at burn, you can look at your runway, you can look  at growth rates, and you can figure out whether the company is default alive.

你可以看看Burn，你可以看看你的跑道，你可以看看增长率，你可以知道公司是否还活着违约。

Let's  go through these in order.

让我们按顺序看一下这些。

Your burn is purely money in minus money out.

你的烧伤是纯粹的钱在减去钱出来。

Again,  you can get this from your bank statements.

同样，你可以从你的银行对账单中得到这一点。

It's effectively just the change in bank  balance between two dates.

实际上，这只是两个日期之间银行余额的变化。

As an example, super easy.

举个例子，超级简单。

You have 25K expenses, you have  10K of revenue, so your burn is 15K.

你有25K的费用，你有10K的收入，所以你的烧伤是15K。

If your expenses are a little bit  lumpy, some companies, you might have a one off month, where were you, I don't  know, paid a legal bill or something that's super high, you can do this.

如果你的费用有点不稳定，一些公司，你可能有一个一次性的一个月，你在哪里，我不知道，支付了法律费用或一些超高的东西，你可以做到这一点。

You  can look at average expenses as well to figure out your burn, and that's often  referred to as average burn.

你可以看看平均费用以及计算你的烧伤，这通常被称为平均烧伤。

You might look at just over three months to get  more of an idea.

你可能会看超过三个月，以获得更多的想法。

Then once you know your burn, then you can start to  look at what your runway is.

然后，一旦你知道你的烧伤，然后你可以开始看看你的跑道是什么。

What this means is how long do you have  until you run out of money? The way that you calculate that is you look  at your existing bank balance divided by your average burn, and that gives you a  number of months.

这意味着你还有多长时间用完钱？你计算的方法是你看你现有的银行余额除以你的平均消耗，这就给了你几个月的时间。

Here, we have 150K in the bank.

在这里，我们有15万的银行存款。

We've just calculated our burn  rate to be 15K, and so we have 10 months of runway.

我们刚刚计算出我们的燃烧率为15K，所以我们有10个月的跑道。

Again, super straightforward,  but you'd be amazed at how many companies or how many founders don't know these  numbers for their company.

同样，超级直截了当，但你会惊讶于有多少公司或多少创始人不知道他们公司的这些数字。

Just a point here that, again, the burn might change over  time.

只是这里的一点，再一次，烧伤可能会随着时间的推移而改变。

But this is a number for you, this is not a number to try  to make things look good.

但这是给你的数字，这不是一个试图让事情看起来更好的数字。

This is for you to not lie to yourself.

这是让你不要对自己撒谎。

So  looking at the burn and going, "Well, this month it was 15K but let's just  pretend it was 10K, so then that makes it look like that we have 15  months of runway left." All you're doing is lying to yourself.

所以看着烧伤，然后说，“这个月是15K，但让我们假设它是10K，那么这看起来就像我们还剩下15个月的跑道一样。”你所做的一切都是在欺骗自己。

You're still going to  run out of money on the same day.

你还是会在同一天花光钱。

It's just making you feel better right  now.

只是让你现在感觉好点。

It's super important to really be honest with yourself on these.

在这些问题上对自己诚实是非常重要的。

You can also  look at your growth rate.

你也可以看看你的增长率。

This is just looking at two periods of time, so  your money in in month two minus your money in in month one, divided by  your money in in month one.

这只是看两个时间段，所以你在第二个月的钱减去你在第一个月的钱，除以你在第一个月的钱。

This is looking at the rate that your revenue  is increasing.

这是看你的收入增长的速度。

In our example here, we have 10K of revenue in July, 12K in  August, and so our growth rate is 20%.

在我们这里的示例中，我们在7月份有10K的收入，在8月份有12 K的收入，因此我们的增长率为20%。

Just a note for the people that  weren't the math wizes at school, a constant growth rate is what's going to give  you the J-curve in growth of revenue.

对于那些在学校不是数学智者的人来说，一个恒定的增长率将会给你带来收入增长的J曲线。

Because if you have 20% growing each month,  as your numbers increase each month, that 20% is a larger number.

因为如果你每个月都有20%的增长，随着你的数字每个月都在增加，这20%是一个更大的数字。

Okay.

好吧。

Then the  final one is whether the company is default alive, or the other side of it  is, is it default dead? The way you calculate this is, if your expenses are  constant and your revenue growth that you've just calculated continues, have you got enough cash  to reach profitability? There's a handy little calculator that Trevor Blackwell, who's one of the  founders of Y Combinator, created for you to do this.

那么，最后一个问题是，公司是否还活着违约，或者它的另一方是，它是违约死亡吗？你的计算方法是，如果你的费用是恒定的，并且你刚刚计算的收入增长继续，你有足够的现金来达到盈利吗？Y Combinator的创始人之一Trevor Blackwell为您创建了一个方便的小计算器。

Basically, there are three things  that you can play with.

基本上，有三样东西可以玩。

You can look at your monthly expenses, which is the  red line, you can look at your monthly revenue starting point, which is the green  point over at the start, and then you can change the gradient of that line  to be your growth rate and it will calculate where you become profitable and how  much capital is needed.

你可以查看你的每月支出，这是红线，你可以查看你的月度收入起点，这是开始时的绿点，然后你可以改变这条线的梯度为你的增长率，它会计算你在哪里盈利，需要多少资金。“。

Now, this example isn't the same numbers as the ones that  we've just been working through.

现在，这个例子与我们刚刚处理的数字不同。

In this example, this is assuming that you will need  150K of money to get to profitability and it will take you two years.

在本例中，假设您需要15万美元才能实现盈利，这将需要两年时间。

Those  are really key things to know, because if you only have a 100K of money  in your bank account, you know that you've got a problem and you know that  you either need to find a way to increase your revenue growth or you need  to find a way to cut expenses.

这些都是需要知道的关键事情，因为如果你的银行账户中只有10万美元，你知道你有一个问题，你知道你需要找到一种方法来增加收入增长，或者你需要找到一种方法来削减开支。

Because the whole goal here is to be  at the point where you can find a path to profitability because it gives you  freedom.

因为这里的整个目标是在这样一个点上，你可以找到一条通往盈利的道路，因为它给了你自由。

Being profitable gives you freedom because you aren't in a position to need to  raise money.

盈利给了你自由，因为你不需要筹集资金。

Like dating, if you don't need to raise money, you appear less desperate,  so the investors want to give you money more so it's easier to raise money.

就像约会一样，如果你不需要筹集资金，你看起来就不那么绝望了，所以投资者希望给你更多的钱，这样就更容易筹集资金。

 It's actually really important to have that option.

事实上，拥有这种选择是非常重要的。

It can sometimes be a switch as  well.

有时它也可以是一个开关。

You don't have to necessarily be profitable right now, but if you know that  you could turn off one specific expense or do one specific thing and be profitable,  then that's also a great safety net.

你不必现在就盈利，但如果你知道你可以关闭一项特定的费用或做一件特定的事情来盈利，那么这也是一个很好的安全网。

There's also a really great essay that talks  about this in more detail.

还有一篇非常棒的文章，更详细地谈到了这一点。

This was written by Paul Graham, and you can see  the link here to where that gives you more information on this.

这是保罗·格雷厄姆写的，你可以在这里看到链接，那里可以给你更多的信息。

Again, it's the  kind of thing that when we're doing office hours with founders, it's one of the  first questions we ask, and you'd be amazed how many people don't know the answer.

再说一次，当我们在办公时间和创始人一起工作时，这是我们首先问的问题之一，你会惊讶于有多少人不知道答案。

 These numbers, super easy to calculate, super straightforward.

这些数字，超级容易计算，超级直截了当。

The next problem is that people go  along and they say, "Okay, I've looked at my runway, I've looked at my revenue,  I know all my numbers," and then forget about it.

下一个问题是人们走过去，他们说，“好吧，我看过我的秀台，我看过我的收入，我知道我所有的数字，”然后忘了它。

But actually, this needs to  happen pretty often.

但实际上，这种情况需要经常发生。

You shouldn't be looking at it every quarter or every month, you  should be looking at it at least every week, and if your runway is getting  low or things are looking not very constant, consistent, you should be looking at it  very often, sometimes daily.

你不应该每个季度或每个月都看它，你应该至少每周看一次，如果你的跑道变得很低，或者事情看起来不是很稳定，一致，你应该经常看它，有时每天都看。

Whenever anyone asks, you should know your numbers.

无论何时有人问起，你应该知道你的号码。

Have a thing  now ...

现在有一件事.。

How many of you know how much money is in the company bank  account, if you already have one? Great.

你们中有多少人知道公司银行账户里有多少钱，如果你已经有一个的话？太棒了。

How much of you know your runway? Slightly  less numbers, slightly less hands, but that's pretty good.

你们中有多少人知道自己的跑道？数字稍微少一点，手稍微少一点，但这已经很好了。

I like it.

我喜欢它。

I'm impressed.

我印象深刻。

Okay.

好吧。

 The next one is under-representing your expenses.

下一个是低估你的开支。

If you think back to that default alive  calculator, that assumes that your expenses are going to remain constant.

如果您回想一下默认存活计算器，则假设您的费用将保持不变。

Actually in reality, that's  probably unlikely.

实际上，在现实中，这可能是不太可能的。

Most startups, their expenses will ramp up over time.

大多数初创公司，他们的费用会随着时间的推移而上升。

You should understand how  that's going to happen.

你应该明白这是怎么发生的。

What kind of expenses are going to increase, and what are  they going to increase to? Some examples of expenses that may change over time, the  first one is undervaluing your own time.

什么样的费用会增加，会增加到什么程度？一些可能会随着时间而改变的费用的例子，第一个是低估了你自己的时间。

Particularly in the early days, where you're doing  everything and you're either paying yourself minimum wage or some very small amounts, which by  the way, in California, everybody should pay themselves minimum wage, and you're also doing things  that don't scale in order to acquire users.

尤其是在早期，你什么都做，你要么支付自己最低工资，要么支付很少的工资，顺便说一句，在加州，每个人都应该支付自己的最低工资，而且你也在做一些不能扩大规模的事情，以便获得用户。

That's totally fine, and that's what we  recommend that people do.

这完全没问题，这就是我们建议人们做的事情。

But it can make your customer acquisition costs look lower than  really they are.

但它会使您的客户获取成本看起来比实际情况更低。

You should be aware that, over time as you start to hire  people to look into these, that those expenses are going to go up.

你应该意识到，随着时间的推移，当你开始雇佣人来调查这些问题时，这些费用将会上升。

Hiring people  is not just the salary.

雇佣员工不仅仅是薪水。

For every person that you hire, you need to provide  them with equipment, you need probably desk space, you need health insurance probably depending on  where you're based.

对于你雇佣的每个人，你需要为他们提供设备，你可能需要办公桌空间，你可能需要医疗保险，这可能取决于你所在的地方。

All of these things cost extra money on top of the salary.

所有这些东西除了工资外都需要额外的钱。

 Depending on location, a good rule of thumb is this, an employee will cost about  25 to 50% more than just their salary.

根据地点的不同，一个很好的经验法则是，一个员工的成本将比他们的工资高出大约25%到50%。

If they're being paid a 100K a  year, then your fully loaded cost to the company is going to be somewhere between  125K to 150K.

如果他们的年薪是100K，那么公司的全额成本将在125K到150K之间。

Again, that's super easy to forget about.

再说一次，这是超级容易忘记的。

You think, "Oh, I'm going  to hire an engineer, I'm going to pay them a 100K.

你想，“哦，我要雇一个工程师，我要付给他们10万。

That means that's all  it's going to cost." But it's amazing how those numbers do add up.

这意味着这就是它的全部成本。“但令人惊讶的是，这些数字是如何加起来的。

So just  be aware of those.

所以要注意这些。

Finally, assuming paid acquisition costs remain constant is another mistake that  we see people make a lot.

最后，假设付费收购成本保持不变是我们看到人们犯了很多的另一个错误。

Whilst it may not seem like this, oftentimes in  the early days, is actually easiest to find your early users because they're the ones  that are totally motivated to use the product.

虽然看起来可能不是这样，但通常在早期，实际上最容易找到你的早期用户，因为他们是那些完全有动机使用产品的人。

Actually over time, it gets harder to  find and convert users, and so the cost of doing that goes up.

实际上，随着时间的推移，找到和转换用户变得越来越困难，因此这样做的成本会上升。

Again, you  should be thinking about that.

再说一次，你应该考虑这一点。

You should be looking at what your costs are right  now and seeing, thinking, "Are they reasonable? What do we think they might go up  to?" Because if you can look at things, in the worst case scenario, you calculate  that you have eight months of runway left, but actually then things are better than  that and you end up with 10 months of revenue, then that's bonus, right? You've  got a bit longer to figure things out.

你现在应该看看你的成本是多少，然后思考，“他们合理吗？我们认为他们可能会上升到什么程度？”因为如果你能看到事情，在最坏的情况下，你计算出你还剩下8个月的跑道，但实际上情况比这更好，你最终有10个月的收入，那么这就是奖金，对吧？你有更长的时间去弄明白事情。

Runway is not a vanity metric.

天桥不是虚荣心的指标。

It's  not one of these things that's supposed to make you feel good, it's not one  of the things that supposed to be used to compare yourself against other companies.

这并不是这些让你感觉良好的事情之一，也不是应该用来与其他公司比较的事情之一。

It's  for you to know the health of your company, and so don't ignore this stuff.

这是为了让你知道你公司的健康状况，所以不要忽视这些东西。

 Don't lie to yourself, don't you try to massage these numbers to feel like it's  making yourselves better, because all that's going to happen is you run out of money  and it'll become a shock.

不要欺骗自己，不要试图通过篡改这些数字来让自己感觉更好，因为所有会发生的事情就是你的钱用完了，它会变成一个震撼的东西。

All right.

好的。

These ones now are starting to get a  little bit more as you raise money, as you starting to hire people.

这些人现在开始得到更多，因为你筹集资金，因为你开始雇佣人。

It's good  to bear in mind right now, but these are probably less relevant to a lot  of you for now.

现在记住这是很好的，但是现在这些可能对你们中的很多人来说不太相关。

Okay.

好吧。

The first one is outsourcing responsibility, and often the CEO  will hire a bookkeeper to prepare the finances for a company as they start to  get a little bit more complex, and that's a total normal thing to do.

第一个是外包责任，当公司开始变得有点复杂时，首席执行官通常会雇佣一名簿记员来准备公司的财务，这是完全正常的事情。

We  recommend that people do that.

我们建议人们这样做。

It's usually once people raise some money.

通常是一旦人们筹到一些钱。

It's not a  good use of the CEO's time to be doing the books, and the CEO could  be doing much more high leverage things.

这不是一个很好的利用CEO的时间来做书，CEO可以做更多的高杠杆的事情。

But the thing to bear in mind is  that even though the bookkeeper is doing the books and preparing those numbers, the responsibility  is still everybody's in the company.

但要记住的是，即使簿记员正在做账目并准备这些数字，责任仍然是公司中的每个人。

Particularly the CEO, but all the founders, everybody should  know what these numbers are.

特别是CEO，但是所有的创始人，每个人都应该知道这些数字是什么。

An external bookkeeper isn't going to know the business like  you know the business.

外部簿记员不会像你一样了解业务。

Oftentimes, the way that they work is that they will get  hold of bank statements and they'll see money coming in and they'll see money coming  out and they'll do their best guess about what these things are and they won't  always be right, and you can't really expect them to always be 100% right, because  they're looking at it from a very removed position.

通常，他们的工作方式是，他们会得到银行对账单，他们会看到钱进来，他们会看到钱出来，他们会对这些事情做最好的猜测，他们不会总是正确的，你不能真的期望他们总是100%正确，因为他们是从一个非常遥远的位置看问题的。

So it's up to the founders  and it's up to the team to look at those reports that the bookkeeper send  every month, and to make sure that you understand them, and to make sure that  if anything that comes through that looks strange, you question.

因此，这取决于创始人，也取决于团队查看簿记员每个月发送的报告，并确保您理解它们，并确保如果出现任何看起来很奇怪的情况，您就会提出疑问。

It's not necessarily ...

不一定.。

I  think a lot of it is that people are concerned that asking questions will make  it look like they don't understand their numbers.

我认为这很大程度上是因为人们担心问题会让人觉得他们不理解自己的数字。

But usually what happens is, if you  don't understand what these numbers are looking like, is usually because there's been some misunderstanding  in the reporting of the numbers.

但通常发生的情况是，如果你不理解这些数字是什么样子的，通常是因为在报告这些数字时存在一些误解。

If you're like, "Well, I thought my revenue was  going to be a bit higher this month.

如果你说，“嗯，我认为我这个月的收入会更高一些。

What's going on? Why is this this  number?" Then you can actually go in and look and query what's going into that,  and you might find that there has been a mistake made.

到底怎么回事？为什么是这个数字？“然后你实际上可以进去看看和询问里面是什么，你可能会发现已经犯了一个错误。

This is probably one  of the number one things that I get founders coming to me complaining about.

这可能是我让创始人来找我抱怨的头号事情之一。

They'll  come up to me in this total panic, and they'll be like, "That bookkeeper messed  up and they told us all this wrong stuff, and now I have no runway  and I don't know what's going on," and actually what happened is the bookkeeper sent  them the monthly reports.

他们会在完全的恐慌中来找我，他们会说，“那个簿记员搞砸了，他们告诉我们所有这些错误的事情，现在我没有跑道，我不知道发生了什么。”实际上发生的是簿记员给他们寄来的月度报告。

They were like, "Tick! Done my work." Founders didn't look at  the reports, didn't figure out what was going on, and now there isn't enough time  left for them to turn the business round either to get profitable or to raise  money to figure things out, and the company dies because it runs out of cash.

他们说，“滴答！完成了我的工作。”创始人没有看报告，没有搞清楚到底发生了什么，现在没有足够的时间让他们扭亏为盈，也没有足够的时间来筹集资金来解决问题，公司之所以会倒闭，是因为它的现金用完了。

 So super, super important to be on this all the time.

所以超级，超级重要的是一直在这个上面。

Hiring too quickly and  scaling the company too quickly is really easy to do, to hire too quickly, because  you're under a lot of pressure to hire people.

招聘得太快，公司扩张得太快，真的很容易做到，招聘得太快，因为你面临着很大的招聘压力。

It feels like it's a really  easy, really measurable piece of information.

感觉这是一条非常简单，非常可测量的信息。

You talk to founders and one of the first  questions that they will often ask is, "Oh, so how many employees are you at  right now?" You say, "Oh, I'm at 25," and you're thinking, "oh no, I've only  got 10 employees.

你和创始人交谈，他们经常会问的第一个问题是，“哦，那么你现在有多少员工？”你说，“哦，我25岁了，”而你在想，“哦不，我只有10个员工。

That means that they're way more successful than I am." Actually, that's  totally not true.

这意味着他们比我成功得多。“事实上，这完全不是真的。

We already mentioned that hiring employees cost more than just their salary.

我们已经提到过雇佣员工的成本不仅仅是他们的工资。

 But you should also be conscious that every hire is actually an investment into the  business, and you should be making sure that you're getting a return on that investment.

但你也应该意识到，每个员工实际上都是对企业的投资，你应该确保你的投资得到回报。

 Now, for some types of employees, that are super easy to measure.

现在，对于某些类型的员工来说，这非常容易衡量。

So think about  a salesperson.

所以想想销售人员。

If they're not bringing in more sales than it's costing the business to  hire them, then clearly, you're not getting a good return on investment.

如果他们没有带来比雇用他们的企业成本更多的销售额，那么很明显，你没有得到很好的投资回报。

But then think  about a community manager or a support manager, it's much harder to measure that, and  that's one of the things that, as a CEO, you need to be looking at  and you need to be figuring out to make sure that all the people in  your company are actually working to make the company more valuable.

但再想想社区经理或支持经理，要衡量这一点要困难得多，这是作为首席执行官，你需要关注的事情之一，你需要弄清楚，确保公司中的所有人都在努力让公司变得更有价值。

Sadly, this is the  point where, if people aren't working out, you should be prepared to fire fast.

可悲的是，这是一个点，如果人们没有锻炼，你应该做好快速开火的准备。

If  people aren't pulling their weight, then they need to leave the company.

如果人们没有尽到自己的责任，那么他们就需要离开公司。

Like I say,  it's easy to fall into this trap, the more people you have, the better you're  doing.

就像我说的，很容易掉进这个陷阱，你的人越多，你做得越好。

But actually the best companies do more with less.

但实际上，最好的公司用更少的钱做更多的事情。

Actually, the real way that  you should measure yourselves is, what's my ratio of revenue to employees? Because the higher  that is, the better you're doing.

实际上，你应该衡量自己的真正方式是，我的收入与员工的比率是多少？因为那越高，你做得越好。

You're doing more with less.

你在用更少的钱做更多的事。

That's the path to  being profitable from an early stage, which then takes the pressure off too, the worry  about whether the company is going to continue.

这是从早期阶段开始盈利的道路，然后也减轻了压力，担心公司是否会继续下去。

It's also easy to feel like you  have to compete with all the flashy startups that have raised bunches of money and  they're all hiring data scientists right now, and "Oh, that means I must need a  data scientist, so I better hire a data scientist." Actually, don't.

你也很容易感觉到，你必须与所有已经筹集了大量资金的浮华初创公司竞争，他们现在都在雇佣数据科学家，而且“哦，这意味着我必须需要一名数据科学家，所以我最好雇一名数据科学家。”实际上，不要。

Again, the best companies  do more with less, and if you can build a really great company with less  employees, then that's amazing for everybody involved.

同样，最好的公司用更少的钱做更多的事情，如果你能用更少的员工建立一个真正伟大的公司，那么这对参与其中的每个人来说都是令人惊讶的。

Bear in mind, you should be treating this  money carefully.

记住，你应该小心对待这笔钱。

It's not a case of just, "Oh, I need to hire this person.

这不是一个简单的情况，“哦，我需要雇用这个人。

 I need to hire that person," because what the investors who are giving you this  money for, they're asking you to do something, basically a miracle.

我需要雇用那个人，“因为给你这笔钱的投资者是为了什么，他们要求你做一些事情，基本上是一个奇迹。

They're asking you to  take their money and turn it into 10 or a 100 times that amount of  money to give back to them.

他们要求你把他们的钱变成10或100倍的钱还给他们。

The way you're going to do that is by  being careful with your expenses and making sure that your revenue grows.

你要做到这一点的方法是小心你的开支，并确保你的收入增长。

As a follow  on to that, scaling before you get product market fit is also another dangerous thing  that people fall into quite easily.

随之而来的是，在你获得产品市场适合之前的规模也是另一件危险的事情，人们很容易陷入其中。

At the point where you're still figuring out what  your product is and you're trying to find product market fit, you should be spending  as little as possible, and then that will give you the runway to have time  to figure out what it is that you should be building, and then people will  be beating down the door to buy your product.

在你仍然在弄清楚你的产品是什么的时候，你正在试图找到适合你的产品市场，你应该尽可能少花钱，然后这将给你提供跑道时间来弄清楚你应该建造什么，然后人们就会敲开门来购买你的产品。

More employees will not help you  get to product market fit.

更多的员工不会帮助你获得产品市场的契合度。

It will not help you get there faster, it will  not help you get there more efficiently.

它不会帮助你更快地到达那里，它不会帮助你更有效率地到达那里。

One of the conversations that I have with  founders is something along the lines of, "Oh, my sales are low because I don't  really have enough salespeople.

我与创始人的对话之一是这样的，“哦，我的销售额很低，因为我没有足够的销售人员。

So if I hire another couple of salespeople, then my sales  will obviously increase." That doesn't sound like product market fit to me.

所以如果我再雇几个销售人员，那么我的销售额就会明显增加。“这听起来不像是适合我的产品市场。

If you have  that, then customers are beating a path to your door, and it feels like the  wheels are falling off as you're trying to look after all those customers.

如果你有这种感觉，那么客户就会打出一条通往你家门口的路，而当你试图照顾所有这些客户时，感觉就像轮子掉了一样。

Just hiring  more salespeople isn't necessarily going to be the thing that sets that going.

仅仅雇佣更多的销售人员并不一定会成为决定这一点的因素。

Also, convincing  yourself that you need more developers or you need more people to get the thing  that gives you the product market fit.

同时，说服自己你需要更多的开发人员或者你需要更多的人来获得让你适合产品市场的东西。

Another conversation along this is something like, "I  need four more developers because then I can build feature X, Y and Z, and  then obviously, everybody will buy it." But again, if you have product market fit, then  even your janky V zero that doesn't have all of these fancy things, is solving  a big enough problem for everybody that they are willing to pay for it and  they love you for it anyway, and then you can start building up on the  more features, and then you can start hiring to do that.

另一个对话是这样的，“我还需要四个开发人员，因为这样我就可以构建特性X，Y和Z，然后显然，每个人都会购买它。”但再说一次，如果你有适合的产品市场，那么即使你的Janky Vzero没有所有这些花哨的东西，也解决了一个足够大的问题，每个人都愿意为它买单，而且他们无论如何都爱你，然后你可以开始构建更多的功能，然后你就可以开始雇佣人来做这件事。

This is the one  that there's no coming back from.

这是一个永远不会回来的人。

The other ones, if you make these mistakes, you  can probably solve this, and if you hire too quickly, you can figure that out.

其他的，如果你犯了这些错误，你可能会解决这个问题，如果你雇佣得太快，你可以解决这个问题。

 If you don't know your numbers, you can learn your numbers.

如果你不知道你的数字，你可以学习你的数字。

This is the one  that is no going back.

这是一个不能回头的人。

If you let your runway get too low before raising,  you're going to have problems raising your money.

如果你在筹集资金之前让你的跑道变得太低，你将会遇到筹集资金的问题。

The first thing is you should always  assume that you will never raise any more money.

第一件事是你应该总是假设你永远不会再筹到更多的钱了。

Always assume that the previous money  that you raised will be your last, and that you should be aiming to get  to profitability on that money.

总是假设你之前筹集的钱将是你的最后一笔钱，并且你的目标应该是在那笔钱上获得盈利。

Again, the conversations that I have with founders where they  say, "Oh, it's fine.

同样，我与创始人的对话中，他们说，“哦，这很好。

My investors are going to put in another million dollars.

我的投资者将再投入一百万美元。

It'll  be totally fine." That's scary if you're relying on your investors to do that, because  they don't always.

如果你依赖你的投资者来做这件事，那就太可怕了，因为他们并不总是这样。

Sometimes they might, but they don't always.

有时他们可能会，但他们并不总是。

So seed stage money is  the money that you'll raise off and on just an idea.

所以种子阶段的钱就是你会在一个想法上断断续续筹集的钱。

You'll be able to  talk to investors about an idea for a product you've got a hypothesis, that you  want to be able to check and they will give you some money.

你可以和投资者谈论一个产品的想法，你有一个假设，你希望能够检查，他们会给你一些钱。

Once you  get to series A and beyond, that becomes much, much harder.

一旦你达到A系列和更高的水平，这就变得非常困难。

You need sustained growth,  you need to have more of an idea, you need to have product market fit.

你需要持续的增长，你需要更多的想法，你需要有适合市场的产品。

 This is why it's a lot harder to raise money as you go through the  life of the company.

这就是为什么当你在公司的整个生命周期中筹集资金时要困难得多。

In particular, don't leave it too late because if you're running  out of runway, your leverage goes down as you're trying to raise money.

特别是，不要让它太晚，因为如果你跑出跑道，你的杠杆作用会随着你试图筹集资金而下降。

If you  have six months of runway, let's say, and you think you're about to go and  start raising money, that's pretty scary.

比方说，如果你有六个月的走秀时间，你认为你即将开始筹款，那是相当可怕的。

It could take three months more to actually get  an investor to agree to put money in, and as your cash balances are decreasing  over those three months, you're losing leverage.

可能还需要三个月的时间才能真正让投资者同意投入资金，而在这三个月内，你的现金余额正在减少，你正在失去杠杆作用。

You can see from here that probably six  months, maybe you can just about pull itself, but really you want to be thinking,  about 12 months runway, that's the point where you're thinking, "Okay, maybe I need to  think about whether I raise money or whether I'm thinking about getting into profitability." Also,  if you get to six months and you're unsuccessful in raising money, you really don't  have a lot of time to turn this around to get to profitability for the  company to succeed.

从这里你可以看到，大概六个月，也许你可以自己拉动自己，但实际上你想要考虑，大约12个月的跑道，这就是你想要的点，“好吧，也许我需要考虑我是筹集资金还是我是否正在考虑进入盈利能力。”此外，如果你在六个月内没有成功筹集资金，你真的没有太多的时间来扭转局面，让公司获得盈利，从而取得成功。

Again, there's a really great essay on our blog that goes into  this in more detail.

同样，我们的博客上有一篇非常棒的文章，对此进行了更详细的介绍。

Link down here, so you can read that at your leisure  and hopefully take that on board.

链接到这里，这样你就可以在闲暇时阅读它，并希望把它带上飞机。

Okay.

好吧。

In conclusion, most companies die because they run  out of money.

总而言之，大多数公司都是因为用完了钱而倒闭的。

It's super easy not to run out of money just by looking  at a certain number of things.

只看一定数量的东西就不会把钱花光，这是超级容易的。

Knowing your cash balance in your runway, understanding how  your expenses are going to increase, understanding that the ratio of revenue to employees is  a better metric than just the number of employees, and having a plan to get  to profitability because you should assume you're not going to raise any more money.

了解你在跑道上的现金余额，了解你的支出将如何增加，了解收入对员工的比率是一个更好的衡量标准，而不仅仅是员工数量，并且制定一个实现盈利的计划，因为你应该假设你不会筹集更多的钱了。

All  right.

好吧。

Thank you very much.

非常感谢。

A few minutes for questions.
Speaker 2:I've always thought the way you're saying it, that you should try to get profitability  on a shoestring, if possible.

几分钟的提问时间。演讲者2：我一直认为你说这件事的方式，如果可能的话，你应该试着小本经营。

But I've read articles which claim that you need being  profitable is bad somehow.

但我读过一些文章，声称你需要盈利，但不知何故是不好的。

So from value, you should try and raise vast sums of  money and not being profitable, and get tight market share and go along those lines.

因此，从价值上看，你应该尝试筹集大量资金，而不是盈利，并获得紧缺的市场份额，并沿着这些路线前进。

 What do you think of those claims and that's something that can be bought for?
Kirsty Nathoo:So the question is, how do you balance the two sides of, you should do  things on a shoe string and be profitable as early as possible versus you should  just throw money and get market share as fast as possible? I think it depends  on the stage of the company, as well.

你对这些索赔有什么看法，这是可以买到的东西？Kirsty Nathoo：所以问题是，你应该如何平衡这两方面，你应该用鞋带做事情并尽早盈利，而你应该尽可能快地投入资金并获得市场份额？我认为这也取决于公司所处的阶段。

In the early days, then probably being  careful with your money and making sure that you have a plan to get to  profitability is a good thing.

在最初的日子里，那么可能对你的钱小心翼翼，并确保你有一个实现盈利的计划是一件好事。

Just having a plan doesn't mean that you necessarily to  actually be doing it.

仅仅有一个计划并不意味着你一定要真的去做。

An example might be, maybe you're plowing all of your revenues  back into marketing in some description or rather, and knowing that you could actually slow  your ...

一个例子可能是，也许你正在把你所有的收入都投入到市场营销中，或者更确切地说，你知道你实际上可以放慢你的.

The way to reduce your expenses is to reduce your marketing, which might  slow your revenue a little bit, but it would conserve that cash to preserve the  runway, it's just a balancing act.

减少你的支出的方法是减少你的营销，这可能会稍微减缓你的收入，但它会节省现金来保护跑道，这只是一种平衡行为。

I mean, the other thing you have to bear  in mind is that, obviously the investors want you to spend money super fast.

我的意思是，你必须记住的另一件事是，显然投资者希望你以超快的速度花钱。

They  want you to come back to them, cap in hand, with, "Please, please.

他们想让你回到他们身边，戴着帽子，说，“拜托，拜托。

Give us  more money." There are some tensions there, but it's all about just being responsible with  it and giving yourself enough time and enough runway to be able to figure it  out.
Speaker 3:[inaudible] CFO again, and I'm just curious at what stage do you bring the CFO  on for a non-fintech company? Do you start with a part time CFO first, and  graduate to a proper CFO full time?
Kirsty Nathoo:Okay.

给我们更多的钱。“这里有一些紧张关系，但关键是要对此负责，给自己足够的时间和足够的跑道来搞清楚。演讲者3：[听不见]CFO，我只是好奇，你会在什么阶段让非金融科技公司的CFO上任？你会先从兼职CFO开始，然后再毕业到一个合适的全职CFO吗？Kirsty Nathoo：好的。

The question is when do you bring in a CFO? It's surprisingly later, actually.

问题是你什么时候请CFO来？实际上，出乎意料的晚了。

 Even probably post series A, you probably don't need a full time CFO at that  point, and there's lots of services that do consulting CFOs and will do strategy or  help you to figure out your numbers to create a deck or whatever for raising  money.

即使可能发布了A系列，你可能也不需要全职CFO，而且有很多服务做CFO咨询，会制定战略或帮助你计算数字，创建一副牌或其他任何筹款的工具。

A full time CFO is actually pretty late on.

一个全职的CFO实际上已经很晚了。

Just to bear in mind  though, that the difference between a CFO and a bookkeeper, at least for the US,  is that generally the way that this works is the bookkeeper, you would have earlier.

不过，请记住，CFO和簿记员之间的区别，至少对美国来说，是这样的，通常是簿记员，你会更早。

 They're the people who are just going to get your numbers that are coming through  your bank statements into a balance sheet, into an income statement, into the accounting system,  so that providing the reports for that.

他们只是要把你的数字通过你的银行对帐单输入到资产负债表，进入损益表，进入会计系统，以便提供报告，为这一点提供报告。

Then separately to that, you would hire a  CPA, an accountant, who would prepare the tax returns and file those for you each  year.

另外，你需要聘请一名注册会计师，一名会计师，他每年都会为你准备纳税申报表并将其归档。

There's actually two different sets of people.

实际上有两种不同的人。

So a bookkeeper you would need earlier,  a CPA you need annually to do your tax returns, and then a CFO who's  going to oversee that and do more of the building our forecasts, building out budgets  and things like that are probably a little bit later on, as well.

所以你之前需要一个簿记员，你每年需要一个注册会计师来做你的纳税申报表，然后是一位CFO，他将监督这一点，并做更多的工作，建立我们的预测，建立预算和诸如此类的事情可能也会稍晚一些。

Before that  is really the founders.

在此之前，真正的创始人。

They should be doing it.
Speaker 4:[inaudible]
Speaker 5:Yeah.

他们应该这么做。扬声器4：[听不见]扬声器5：是的。

My question is regarding the [inaudible] Do you suggest any financial projections tools or  any financial [inaudible] tools?
Kirsty Nathoo:So how can you calculate it? I mean, there are tools online.

我的问题是关于[听不见的]你有没有建议任何财务预测工具或任何财务[听不见]工具？Kirsty Nathoo：那么你是如何计算它的呢？我是说，网上有工具。

Personally, I think  it's actually better to build it yourself, because I think it makes you think about  it in your mind.

就我个人而言，我认为自己构建它实际上更好，因为我认为它会让你在脑海中思考它。

Usually just doing good old spreadsheets, for me, works well.

通常只是做好旧的电子表格，对我来说，工作得很好。

But  certainly there are other ways that you can do it, and there's a lot of  services and a lot of startups.

当然，还有其他方法可以做到这一点，而且有很多服务和创业公司。

We see a lot of startups applying to us  trying to make it easier to see forecasts and things.

我们看到很多初创公司向我们申请，试图让我们更容易看到预测和事情。

Okay, maybe one more question,  and then we'll move on.

好吧，也许再问一个问题，然后我们继续。

Let's get this side.
Speaker 6:We haven't found product market fit yet, [inaudible]
Kirsty Nathoo:You haven't found product market fit?
Speaker 6:Yeah.

我们走这边。演讲者6：我们还没有找到适合的产品市场，[听不见]Kirsty Nathoo：你还没有找到适合的产品市场吗？扬声器6：是的。

[inaudible] product market fit yet [inaudible] for marketing our [inaudible]
Kirsty Nathoo:Oh, for investors? Are you raising seed stage money? Yeah.

[听不见]产品市场是否适合[听不见]我们的[听不见]Kirsty Nathoo：哦，对投资者来说？你在筹集种子期资金吗？嗯。

Okay.

好吧。

The question is, should  you provide forecasts in your deck if you haven't reached product market fit? The answer  is probably no.

问题是，如果你还没有达到产品市场的适合度，你是否应该在你的甲板上提供预测？答案可能是否定的。

Certainly, at the seed stage, if you're talking to professional investors or  experienced investors, they probably aren't really going to look or ask you for that number,  they'll ask you for things like, "So how big could this get, and what's the  total market size?" Questions like that.

当然，在种子阶段，如果你与专业投资者或有经验的投资者交谈，他们可能不会真的去看或者问你这个数字，他们会问你，“那么这个能有多大，总的市场规模是多少？”类似的问题。

But they're not going to be looking for here's  our monthly growth predictions.

但他们不会去寻找，这是我们的月度增长预测。

Probably if you're being asked those kinds of questions from investors  and you're raising money at the seed stage, it probably means that those investors are  not actually that experienced in investing in early stage companies.

可能如果你被投资者问到这些问题，并且你在种子阶段筹集资金，这可能意味着那些投资者实际上在投资早期公司方面没有那么丰富的经验。

So that's a data point  for you to decide whether it's a good person to work with.

所以这是一个数据点，你可以决定它是否是一个好的合作对象。

Certainly by the  time you get to series A however, you should have some plans.

当然，当你进入A系列的时候，你应该有一些计划。

But the point  of a series A is that you've got product market fit and that you have  more of an idea.

但A系列的要点是，你已经有了适合市场的产品，而且你有更多的想法。

I mean, forecasts are always forecast.

我的意思是，预测总是预测。

You don't know for sure,  but yeah.

你不确定，但是的。

Okay.

好吧。

I think we are up.

我想我们起来了。

Thank you very much.

非常感谢。

I'm doing an  AMA on Friday, so if there's questions that I didn't get to, then feel free  to drop them in there and I will answer as many as possible of those.

我周五要做AMA，所以如果有我没有回答的问题，那么请随意把它们放在那里，我会回答尽可能多的问题。

 Thank you.

谢谢。
