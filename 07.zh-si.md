# Kat Manalac - How to Launch (Again and Again)


Kim [Mihalik 00:00:01].

Kim[Mihalik 00：00：01]。

I'm a partner at Y Combinator and one of the things  I help founders do a lot is prepared a launch.

我是Y Combinator的合伙人，我帮助创始人做的一件事就是准备推出。

That is what I'm going  to talk to you about today.

这就是我今天要和你们谈的。

So I want to change the way you think  about launching.

所以我想改变你对发射的看法。

So most people think about launching as something that you get one shot  at.

所以大多数人都把发射看作是你只需一次机会就能完成的事情。

So for example, I just talked to a team that's been preparing to launch  for six months.

举个例子，我刚刚和一个已经准备了六个月的团队进行了交谈。

They were lovingly trying to get every pixel perfect on their product  before they shared it with everyone.

他们亲切地试图在与每个人分享之前，让他们的产品的每一个像素都完美无瑕。

Now, they are stressing over every line on their  landing page, and they're trying to line up everything right with timing.

现在，他们在他们的登录页面上的每一行上都有压力，并且他们试图按照时间安排好每件事。

But if you're  like most startups, you will launch something, no one will care.

但如果你像大多数初创公司一样，你会推出一些东西，没有人会在意。

If it took you  six months to get there, your startup is probably going to be dead before you  get another chance to launch.

如果你花了六个月的时间才到达那里，那么你的创业公司很可能在你得到下一次启动机会之前就已经破产了。

So in the same sort of spirit at always be  shipping, I want you to think about launching as something you can continually do.

因此，本着一贯的精神，我希望你考虑把发射作为你可以持续做的事情。

I  want to destroy the idea that launching is just this one moment in time.

我想打破那种认为发射只是这一刻的想法。

Because  assuming you do well and assuming you ship new products and new features, you are  never going to be not launching.

因为假设你做得很好，假设你发布了新产品和新功能，你永远不会不发布。

So let's talk about all the ways that you  can launch.

所以让我们谈谈你可以启动的所有方式。

Here are different opportunities to launch that we're going to go through today.

下面是我们今天将要经历的不同的发布机会。

 I'll go through each of these except press launches.

除了新闻发布会之外，我将逐一介绍这些内容。

We have done a previous startups  lecture on press launches, and I'll share a link to that and some resources after  this.

我们之前做过一个关于新闻发布的初创公司讲座，我将分享一个链接和一些资源。

But we'll go over a most of these.

但我们会复习其中的大部分。

And most of these things are  things that you should be doing while you're in Startup School.

这些事情中的大多数都是你在创业学校时应该做的事情。

So let's talk about,  first, why you want to continuously launch.

所以让我们先来谈谈，为什么你想要持续的发射。

So before you even have a fully-functioning product,  you get a chance to practice your pitch and you can refine it.

因此，在你拥有一个功能齐全的产品之前，你有机会练习你的推介，你可以完善它。

You can  A/B Test it and see how people actually respond to the idea.

你可以A/B测试它，看看人们对这个想法的实际反应。

Then, once you  have an MVP or a very early version of your product, launching through different channels  will give you an opportunity to see how people will respond to that early version  of the product.

然后，一旦你有了MVP或产品的早期版本，通过不同的渠道发布将给你一个机会，看看人们会如何回应该产品的早期版本。

You know, and then launching to different channels will help you determine  whether you're even talking to the right users.

你知道，然后启动到不同的渠道将帮助你确定你是否在与正确的用户交谈。

Because, you might launch on one channel  and get no response, you'll launch on another channel and you'll get a huge response.

因为，您可能在一个通道上启动而没有得到响应，您将在另一个通道上启动，您将得到巨大的响应。

 So that will help you identify whether you're identifying the right user for what you're  building.

因此，这将帮助您确定您正在构建的内容是否标识了正确的用户。

So let's talk about some of the types of launches that you can do  while you're in Startup School, and I'm excited to hear that 1,000 of you have  launched so far since the start of Startup School.

所以让我们谈谈你在创业学校时可以做的一些类型的启动，我很高兴听到你们中的1000人自创业学校开始以来已经启动了。

That's incredible.

太不可思议了。

So I clicked on  10 random Startup School companies from founders who posted on the forum and only about  half had landing pages.

所以我随机点击了10家创业学校的公司，他们都是在论坛上发帖的创始人，只有一半左右有登陆页面。

So this is what I call the silent launch.

这就是我所说的无声发射。

You do  not need anything fancy for this.

你不需要任何花哨的东西。

You know, all you need is a domain name,  your company name, a short description, a contact, and a call to action.

你知道，你所需要的只是一个域名，你的公司名称，一个简短的描述，一个联系人，和一个行动号召。

So for  example, this is a random Startup School company that I found from a founder who  posted on the forum.

举个例子，这是一个随机的创业学校公司，我从一个在论坛上发帖的创始人那里找到的。

Their company is [Zinc 00:02:59].

他们的公司是[Zinc 00：02：59]。

They have a domain name, they  have their company name, they have their short one-line pitch, a short description, and they're  called to action, which is, "Get in touch." The call to action can be something  like, "Subscribe to our newsletter." Or, "Subscribe to hear more when we launch.".

他们有一个域名，他们有他们的公司名称，他们有他们的简短的一行推介，简短的描述，他们被要求采取行动，那就是，“联系”。行动号召可以类似于“订阅我们的时事通讯”。或者，“订阅，以便在我们发布时听到更多信息。”

Product Hunt,  for example, has an actual product for pre-launch companies called Ship.

例如，Product Hunt为发射前的公司提供了一个名为Ship的实际产品。

It's a way to  collect potential interest from potential users.

这是一种从潜在用户那里收集潜在兴趣的方法。

So, for example, this is something called Designer School,  and it has a quick intro from the founders, a short description of what the  company does, and the call to action, which is, "Subscribe." So you can go on  Product Hunt and set up one of these pages.

举个例子，这是一个叫做设计学院的东西，它有一个来自创始人的简短介绍，对公司业务的简短描述，以及行动号召，也就是“订阅”。因此，您可以继续产品搜索并设置其中一个页面。

But, of course, you can also  build your own landing page incredibly quickly and easily.

但是，当然，你也可以令人难以置信地快速和轻松地构建自己的登录页面。

This should be something that if  you don't have one yet, that you do this weekend.

如果你还没有的话，这应该是你这个周末要做的事情。

So the next thing is  the friends and family launch.

所以下一件事就是朋友和家人的发布。

So if you're at idea stage, you can test out  your short pitch on family and friends and see how they respond.

因此，如果你处于想法阶段，你可以在家人和朋友身上测试一下你的简短推介，看看他们如何回应。

Once you have  an MVP, do a friends and family launch as quickly as possible.

一旦你有了MVP，尽快做一次朋友和家人的发布。

So in its  earliest days, Reddit was shared just among the founders of their batch at YC.

因此，在最初的日子里，Reddit只在YC的创始人之间分享。

You  know, there were only eight companies.

你知道，当时只有八家公司。

It was a really small community.

那是一个非常小的社区。

I used the  Wayback Machine to actually see what Reddit looked like in its earliest days.

我用Wayback Machine实际看到了Reddit早期的样子。

It hasn't  changed that much.

它并没有改变太多。

But if you look closely, this is actually before they called upvotes,  upvotes.

但如果你仔细看，这实际上是在他们叫提名票，提名票之前。

They were calling it boosts.

他们称之为助推器。

This is like 2005, I think July.

这就像是2005年，我想是7月。

So that's  how they got their very first users, just sharing it among their community of founders.

这就是他们如何获得他们的第一批用户，只是在他们的创始人社区中分享。

 So what I recommend you do is share the product with your friends and family,  watch them use it.

所以我建议你做的是和你的朋友和家人分享这个产品，看他们使用它。

You know, sit down next to them and ask for feedback.

你知道，坐在他们旁边，询问反馈意见。

 But don't stay in this phase for too long because your friends and family might  not be the exact right, ideal user for your product or what you're building.

但是不要在这个阶段停留太长时间，因为你的朋友和家人可能不是你的产品或你正在构建的东西的完全正确的理想用户。

So  sometimes their feedback isn't quite as helpful as a real user's is.

所以有时候他们的反馈并不像真正的用户那样有帮助。

So for example,  if Alexis and Steve had shared this with their parents, their parents might've been like,  "What the hell is this?" So get out of that family and friends circuit as  fast as you can.

例如，如果Alexis和Steve把这个分享给他们的父母，他们的父母可能会说，“该死的这是什么？”所以尽快离开家人和朋友的圈子。

So the next move would be to launch to strangers.

所以下一步就是向陌生人推出。

So  one of my favorite examples of a YC company launching to strangers is the company  Lugg.

因此，我最喜欢的YC公司向陌生人推出的例子之一是Lugg公司。

So Lugg is an app that lets you call movers and delivery people on  demand.

所以Lugg是一个可以让你按需打电话给搬家和送货人员的应用程序。

So even before Lugg had built a fully-functioning app or product, they would rent  a truck and they would go drive to Ikea and they would sit outside of  Ikea.

因此，甚至在Lugg还没有建立起一个功能齐全的应用程序或产品之前，他们就会租一辆卡车，然后开车去宜家，然后坐在宜家外面。

So they would watch shoppers, and they'd look for people who were having a  particularly difficult time tying stuff to the top of their cars.

所以他们会观察购物者，他们会寻找那些把东西绑在车顶上特别困难的人。

They'd run up to  those customers, and they'd say, "Hey.

他们会跑到那些顾客面前，他们会说，“嘿。

Instead of trying to tie this mattress on top  of your car, wouldn't it be cool if you could just push a button and  someone with a truck would come and help do this for you?" You know, the  customers would be like sweating, and they'd be like, "Yes, that's exactly what I need  at this moment.".

与其试着把这个床垫绑在你的车顶上，如果你只需按一个按钮，然后有人开着卡车过来帮你做这件事，那岂不是很酷？“你知道，顾客会像出汗一样，他们会说，”是的，这正是我现在需要的。“

You know, they'd download the app, they'd click the Lugg button, and  then the founder would run back to the parking lot, drive up in his truck,  and then the customer would be like, "Oh my God, it's you." And they were  like, "Yeah." So it was a real hustle at the beginning.

你知道，他们会下载应用程序，他们会点击Lugg按钮，然后创始人会跑回停车场，开着他的卡车，然后客户会说，“哦，天哪，是你。”他们说，“是的。”所以一开始真的很混乱。

Like, none of this  was working on the back end, but it really confirmed for them that this was  a hair on fire problem for their users and customers.

就像，所有这些在后端都不起作用，但对他们来说，这确实证实了这是他们的用户和客户的一个着火问题。

So they decided, "It makes  sense for us to really build this out and spend time on this product.".

所以他们决定，“对我们来说，真正构建这个产品并花时间在这个产品上是有意义的。”

So  launching to strangers will help do that for you.

所以，向陌生人发起将有助于你做到这一点。

It will help show you whether  people are actually willing to download and pay for what it is you're building.

它将帮助您显示人们是否真的愿意下载并为您正在构建的内容付费。

Let's  talk about online communities.

让我们谈谈在线社区。

This is actually one of my favorite ways to launch.

这实际上是我最喜欢的启动方式之一。

I  think you should plan a launch for every single community that you are part of.

我认为你应该为你所在的每一个社区计划一个启动计划。

 So when a company goes through Y Combinator, they have the option of launching on  Bookface before they launch publicly.

因此，当一家公司通过Y Combinator时，他们可以选择在公开发布之前在Bookface上发布。

So Bookface is our internal platform at YC.

所以Bookface是我们YC的内部平台。

It's like  Facebook meets LinkedIn meets Quora.

就像Facebook遇到LinkedIn和Quora一样。

There are currently over 4,000 other founders on Bookface.

目前，Bookface上还有4000多名其他创始人。

So  it's a fairly low-risk way to launch because it's not totally public, but there is  enough of an audience there to get some feedback.

所以这是一种相当低风险的发布方式，因为它不是完全公开的，但那里有足够的观众来获得一些反馈。

You're launching in front of fairly  friendly people who you know want to see you succeed.

你在相当友好的人面前启动，你知道他们希望看到你成功。

So they launched there.

所以他们在那里下水。

What  I think you guys are particularly lucky because you have Startup School and you have  the Startup School forum, which about 40,000 founders are on.

我认为你们特别幸运，因为你们有创业学校和创业学校论坛，大约有4万名创始人。

So if you have an  early version of your product, there is literally no reason that you shouldn't be launching  to the Startup School community in the next few weeks.

因此，如果你有你的产品的早期版本，你没有理由不在接下来的几周内向创业学校社区发布。

I also think that founders  and other people making and building stuff, they give the best early-product feedback.

我还认为创始人和其他人制造和建造东西，他们给出了最好的早期产品反馈。

So you  have thousands of other founders at your disposal.

所以你有数以千计的其他创始人可供你选择。

So I think that this kind of  gives you a leg up here.

所以我认为这种方式给了你一条腿。

Here's a sort of extreme example of a company  that successfully launched in online communities.

这是一个在线社区成功推出的公司的极端例子。

So Magic is an on-demand personal assistant.

所以Magic是一个随需应变的个人助理。

When they  started in Y Combinator in 2015, they were actually building a blood pressure monitoring app.

当他们在2015年在Y Combinator开始的时候，他们实际上是在开发一个血压监测应用程序。

 So they were trying to get this blood pressure monitoring app to grow, and it  wasn't growing as quickly as they were hoping so they decided, "You know, let's test  out another idea that we had." So they sent a link around to their friends  and family and it just looked like this.

所以他们试图让这个血压监测应用程序增长，但它的增长没有他们希望的那么快，所以他们决定，“你知道，让我们测试一下我们有的另一个想法。”所以他们向他们的朋友和家人发送了一个链接，看起来就像这样。

It basically said, "Text phone number and  we'll make anything happen like magic." Like, it was very, very basic.

它基本上是说，“短信电话号码，我们会让任何事情发生就像魔术一样。”就像，这是非常，非常基本的。

One of their  friends thought it was so cool that they shared it on Reddit and Hacker News.

他们的一个朋友认为这很酷，所以他们在Reddit和Hacker News上分享了它。

 And basically overnight, like over the course of a weekend, 40,000 people signed up to  use Magic.

基本上一夜之间，就像一个周末，有4万人注册使用Magic。

So of course, they were like, "Oh my God, this is crazy." Let's  be honest, this is an extreme case and almost no one who launches on Reddit  and Hacker News is going to get 40,000 users overnight.

所以，当然，他们会说，“哦，天哪，这太疯狂了。”老实说，这是一个极端的情况，几乎没有人会在Reddit和Hacker News上发布，一夜之间就能获得4万用户。

But my point is it's  definitely worth putting yourself out there because you might be one of those extreme cases,  but at the very least, you'll get some early users and you'll get some great  feedback.

但我的观点是，这绝对值得把你自己放在那里，因为你可能是那些极端的例子之一，但至少，你会得到一些早期用户，你会得到一些很好的反馈。

So many of the startups that go through YC launch on Hacker News and  Product Hunt.

所以很多通过YC的初创公司都是在黑客新闻和产品猎杀上启动的。

We, over time, have looked at the stats of how well these launches  convert, so a TechCrunch launch versus a Product Hunt launch versus a Hacker News launch.

随着时间的推移，我们已经查看了这些发布的转换情况的统计数据，因此TechCrunch发布与Product Hunt发布对比Hacker News发布。

 In terms of converting to users, they're starting to even out in terms of their  impact and a conversion, whether it's your signups or converting to customers.

在向用户转换方面，他们开始在影响和转换方面达到平衡，无论是注册还是向客户转换。

So if you're  launching in these communities and aren't active members of these communities yet, my suggestion is  that you spend a little bit of time looking at the communities, you understand the  rules, especially if you're posting to subreddits.

因此，如果你在这些社区开展活动，但还不是这些社区的活跃成员，我的建议是你花一点时间查看社区，你了解规则，特别是如果你要发布到subreddits。

They all sort of have their own moderators,  have their own rules.

他们都有自己的主持人，有自己的规则。

Understand the best way to talk to these communities.

了解与这些社区交谈的最佳方式。

If it's  a community that's known for being helpful, ask for advice, ask for feedback.

如果这是一个以乐于助人而闻名的社区，那就寻求建议，寻求反馈。

If you're  not part of these communities, I'd reach out to someone who is and ask them  for advice, ask them for the best way to launch because there are going to  be tips for every community.

如果你不是这些社区的一部分，我会联系那些是的人，向他们寻求建议，问他们最好的启动方式，因为每个社区都会有小贴士。

You know, for example, one company in this batch was  building something that he wanted to get more women's perspectives on.

你知道，例如，这一批中的一家公司正在建造一些他想要得到更多女性观点的东西。

They're two male founders.

他们是两个男性创始人。

 One of the users of Elpha, which is a community for women in tech said,  "Hey, I'll post that to Elpha for you, and I'll tell you what kind of  feedback they got." So I recommend like connecting with someone in the community and asking  them for help if you're not part of the community yourself.

Elpha是一个技术女性社区，它的一个用户说，“嘿，我会为你把它发到Elpha上，我会告诉你他们得到了什么样的反馈。”因此，如果你自己不是社区的一部分，我建议你和社区中的某个人联系起来，并向他们寻求帮助。

The biggest piece of  advice I have for launching on online communities is write like you talk.

对于在线社区的启动，我最大的建议就是像你说的那样写。

Do not  talk like a marketing robot.

别像个营销机器人一样说话。

People hate that.

人们讨厌那样。

So don't use marketing language or deep  jargon.

因此，不要使用营销语言或深奥的行话。

Talk like a human when you're addressing the community.

当你向社区发表演讲时，要像人类一样说话。

So all you need when  you introduce yourself in these posts, introduce yourself, talk about what you're building, talk briefly  about why you're doing it, or how you came across the problem.

所以当你在这些帖子中介绍你自己时，你需要做的就是介绍你自己，谈论你正在建设的东西，简单地谈谈你为什么要这么做，或者你是如何遇到这个问题的。

People on Hacker  News, for example, are super intellectually curious.

例如，Hacker News上的人们就非常好奇。

So are there any interesting insights that you've  learned from talking to potential users or your users? Is there anything surprising or delightful  that you could share with the community? Because people love that, and they also want  to ask you questions but sometimes don't know exactly how or which questions they should  ask you.

那么，从与潜在用户或您的用户的交谈中，您是否了解到了任何有趣的见解？有什么令人惊讶或令人愉快的事情可以和社区分享吗？因为人们喜欢这样，他们也想问你问题，但有时不知道他们应该怎么问你，或者问你哪些问题。

So tee it up for them.

所以为他们开球吧。

Say, "Hey, I'm an expert in X,  Y, and Z, and I'm happy to answer questions on these topics." Otherwise, you risk  people going down all sorts of weird rabbit holes.

说，“嘿，我是X，Y和Z方面的专家，我很乐意回答关于这些主题的问题。”否则，你会冒着人们掉进各种奇怪的兔子洞的风险。

Just make sure that you sort  of are sharing this community, asking them for advice.

只是要确保你正在分享这个社区，向他们征求建议。

Try to cut down as much  of the jargon and marketing as possible out of these pitches.

尽量减少这些宣传中的行话和营销。

Then, request for access  launch.

然后，请求访问启动。

The Magic story that I shared with you actually reminded me of this other  type of launch you can do.

我和你分享的魔术故事实际上让我想起了你可以做的另一种类型的发射。

So when Magic launched, overnight they got 40,000 people  signing up.

所以当Magic推出时，一夜之间就有4万人注册。

Of course, they couldn't serve 40,000 users immediately, so they launched a wait  list.

当然，他们不能立即为4万用户提供服务，所以他们启动了等待名单。

They also gave people ways to skip the line.

他们还给人们提供了跳过这条线的方法。

So, for example, if you  tweeted about Magic, you'd get to skip a few spots in line.

所以，例如，如果你发了关于Magic的推文，你就可以跳过排队的几个位置。

So you can  build these viral elements into your launches that will help get people to spread the  word for you.

因此，您可以将这些病毒元素构建到您的发布中，这将帮助人们为您传播消息。

One of my current favorite examples of this request for access launch  is Superhuman.

我目前最喜欢的这个访问启动请求的例子之一是超人。

So Superhuman is building a better email experience.

因此，超人正在构建更好的电子邮件体验。

So you can go to  their site here and request access, and you can also ask a current user to  refer you and then that'll help you skip the line.

所以你可以去他们的网站申请访问，你也可以要求当前的用户推荐你，然后这将帮助你跳过这一行。

So in the signature of  all emails that are sent by Superhuman users is a little tag that says, "Sent  by Superhuman." So I'm a Superhuman user, and I get a ton of emails.

因此，在所有由超人用户发送的电子邮件的签名中，都有一个小标签，上面写着“由超人发送”。所以我是一个超人的用户，我收到了大量的电子邮件。

I'll  send a ton of my emails out to people, and I get a ton of  emails asking me for referrals.

我会向人们发送大量的电子邮件，我会收到大量的电子邮件要求我推荐。

You know, people I email say, "Hey, how did you  like Superhuman? Would you mind referring me to the product?" So if you have a  product that you can build this sort of viral element into, I highly recommend it.

你知道，我发电子邮件的人会说，“嘿，你喜欢超人吗？你介意把我介绍给这个产品吗？”因此，如果你有一个产品，你可以内置这种病毒的元素，我强烈推荐它。

 So we don't have a huge amount of time because obviously social media and launching  to bloggers is this huge, and long, and well-covered topic.

所以我们没有太多的时间，因为很明显，社交媒体和向博客作者发布是一个巨大的，冗长的，覆盖得很好的话题。

But I wanted to skim  them briefly and give you an example of a company that we worked with that  did it very well.

但我想简要地略读一下，并给大家举一个我们合作过的公司的例子，它做得很好。

As most of you know, launching to popular blogs that cover  your industry or trade can be incredibly powerful.

正如你们大多数人所知道的，发布到流行的博客，覆盖你的行业或贸易可以是令人难以置信的强大。

So Joy is a free wedding website  builder, and they were one of the fastest-growing companies in their batch.

所以Joy是一个免费的婚礼网站建设者，他们是他们一批中发展最快的公司之一。

A lot of  their early growth, like an alarming amount of their really early growth, was due to  being placed on a number of lists like this.

他们的许多早期增长，就像他们真正早期增长的惊人数量一样，都是由于被列在这样的一些名单上。

They essentially googled...

他们基本上是谷歌.。

They looked at  SEO, and they googled, best wedding website builders, and figured out who was coming up  on the first couple pages of results on Google.

他们看了SEO，他们在谷歌上搜索，最好的婚礼网站建设者，并找出谁会出现在谷歌的前几页搜索结果中。

They reached out to all those  bloggers and they said, "Hey, we have this new product.

他们联系了所有的博客作者，他们说，“嘿，我们有这个新产品。

We think your community would  love it.

我们认为你的社区会喜欢的。

Would you be willing to add us to this list?" You know, they  said that they reached out and basically did a drip campaign to over 50 bloggers  and only got responses from four.

你愿意把我们加入这个名单吗？“你知道，他们说他们伸出了手，基本上对50多个博客作者进行了点滴运动，但只得到了4个回复。

But those four responses made a huge impact for  their early growth.

但这四种反应对它们的早期成长产生了巨大的影响。

So one note that I want you to keep in mind is  that some blogger and influencer opportunities are pay-to-play.

所以我想让你记住的一点是，一些博客作者和影响者的机会是付费的。

Joy did not pay early on, and  I do not want you paying early on either.

快乐没有提前支付，我也不希望你提前支付。

If folks are asking you to  pay, please find other or creative routes to get around this because as startups, as  early-stage startups, you don't have the money to do it.

如果人们要求你付款，请找到其他或创造性的途径来绕过这一点，因为作为初创企业，作为早期初创企业，你没有钱这么做。

It is definitely possible to  go this route without paying a ton of money, so figure out ways around the  expensive sort of sponsorship dollars.

走这条路绝对有可能不花一大笔钱，所以要想办法绕过昂贵的赞助费。

If you're a hardware or physical product, of course, you  can do a preorder campaign.

当然，如果你是硬件或实物产品，你可以进行预订活动。

So preparing for preorder launch could honestly be a whole  presentation of its own.

因此，为预购发布做准备可能真的是一个完整的演示。

But take a look at some successful campaigns and get a  sense for how they built out their launch strategy.

但是看看一些成功的营销活动，了解一下他们是如何制定他们的推出战略的。

So, for example, Sheertex was a  company in YC that was making unbreakable sheer pantyhose.

例如，Sheertex是YC的一家制造牢不可破的纯连裤袜的公司。

The founder, Katherine, made a great,  really compelling video that she pitched to press.

创立者凯瑟琳制作了一个很棒的，非常吸引人的视频，她向媒体推介。

She launched on Hacker News, where...

她上了黑客新闻，在那里.。

You  know, Hacker News, it's a very male audience.

你知道，黑客新闻，这是一个非常男性的观众。

So we were curious how they would  respond to something like sheer unbreakable pantyhose.

所以我们很好奇他们会对像牢不可破的连裤袜这样的东西有什么反应。

But they loved it.

但他们很喜欢。

They thought it was  very clever.

他们认为这很聪明。

They thought that the technical piece behind it was really interesting.

他们认为它背后的技术部分真的很有趣。

You know,  so I would recommend any company try to launch and see how different communities respond.

你知道，所以我会建议任何公司尝试推出，看看不同的社区如何反应。

 She launched on Product Hunt.

她启动了Product Hunt。

She asked her friends, and family, and batchmates, and investors  to help spread the word.

她要求她的朋友、家人、批友和投资者帮助传播这一消息。

She had an incredibly successful campaign.

她的竞选非常成功。

So, of course, there's  a new feature or new product line launches.

因此，当然，有一个新的功能或新的产品线推出。

So two very different companies that do  this incredibly well are Stripe and Glossier.

因此，两个非常不同的公司在这方面做得令人难以置信的好，是Strive和Glossier。

So both companies are incredibly smart about how  they launch new products.

因此，两家公司在如何推出新产品方面都非常聪明。

So Stripe has always been great from the very beginning.

所以条纹从一开始就很棒。

They've  been really great at engaging the community.

他们在参与社区方面真的很棒。

So every time they launch a product...

所以每次他们推出产品.。

So,  for example, when they launched Stripe Atlas, they launched it on Hacker News and the  founders were in the thread talking to all potential users, and talking about the product,  and why they were launching it, the problems that they felt it was solving.

所以，例如，当他们推出条纹地图集时，他们在Hacker News上发布了它，创始人们正在与所有潜在用户交谈，讨论产品，以及他们为什么要发布它，他们认为它正在解决的问题。

They  blogged about it.

他们在博客上写了这件事。

They spread the word on social media.

他们在社交媒体上传播消息。

They pitched press.

他们向媒体投掷。

And this  is something that they do over and over again.

这是他们一遍又一遍地做的事情。

If you look at Stripe's blog,  if you look at Hacker News, you can kind of see the history since the  beginning.

如果你看斯特里奇的博客，如果你看黑客新闻，你可以看到从一开始的历史。

They've been very great at sort of activating the community.

他们在激活社区方面表现得非常出色。

Glossier, which is a  beauty brand, is incredible at launching new product.

Glossier是一个美容品牌，在推出新产品方面令人难以置信。

The way they think about it is  actually very scientific.

他们思考这件事的方式实际上是非常科学的。

They release products on a very specific cadence at specific intervals.

他们以非常特定的节奏，以特定的间隔发布产品。

For  every product, they essentially hit every single launch button again and again, so community, social  media, press, advertising.

对于每个产品，他们基本上一次又一次地点击每个单独的启动按钮，所以社区，社交媒体，广告。

So each time this new product launches, which is basically like every  six to eight weeks, they have the cycle going.

所以每次这个新产品发布的时候，基本上每六到八个星期，他们就会有一个循环。

So there's a constant drum beat  about Glossier out in the world.

所以世界上有一个关于Glossier的持续的鼓点。

One last note before we jump into questions is  while you're in Startup School, you should start to build your own communities.

在我们进入问题之前，最后一点要注意的是，当你在创业学校时，你应该开始建立你自己的社区。

You can  do this even really pre-product.

你可以做到这一点，即使是真正的前期产品。

So there was one YC founder, Gadi Evron, who was  founder of Symmetria, and he had a really particularly successful TechCrunch launch.

所以有一个YC的创始人，Gadi Evron，Symmetria的创始人，他有一个非常成功的TechCrunch发布。

A TechCrunch launch  is a story about what they were doing launched in TechCrunch.

TechCrunch发布是关于他们在TechCrunch中发布的内容的故事。

I had noticed that  they had a ton of shares, a ton of engagement.

我注意到他们有大量的股份，大量的参与。

So I asked them to  share, "How did you set this up? What did you do to share and spread  the word about your launch?" He said that over the years, even before launching the  product, he started to build his own email list.

所以我让他们分享，“你是怎么设置的？你做了什么来分享和传播关于你的发射的消息？”他说，多年来，甚至在推出该产品之前，他就开始建立自己的电子邮件列表。

So every person he met that  he discussed his startup with, even very loosely, he would add them an email list.

因此，他遇到的每个人，他与他讨论他的创业，甚至非常宽松，他会添加他们的电子邮件列表。

 They would get sort of email updates about what he was working on, at semi-regular  intervals.

他们会以半定期的间隔收到关于他工作内容的电子邮件更新。

So when the TechCrunch article came out, he said he sent that email to  the list full of all the people that he ever talked to, other startup founders,  investors, friends, family, and asked for their help in spreading the news.

因此，当TechCrunch的文章发表时，他说他把那封电子邮件发给了他曾经交谈过的所有人，其他初创公司的创始人，投资者，朋友，家人，并请求他们帮助传播这个消息。

He said, "The  response was significant." He even saw VCs who hadn't invested in them sharing the story  from their own personal Twitter accounts.

他说，“反应非常显著。”他甚至看到没有在他们身上投资的风投们在自己的Twitter账户上分享了这个故事。

He said, "You know, you would be really surprised  by who comes out of the woodwork to help when you ask for it." So  I would recommend, while you're in Startup School, you have the opportunity to talk to  so many people about what you're building and ask them, "Hey, can I add you  to my update list?" And over time, you'll get that into the hundreds, maybe even  thousands.

他说，“你知道，当你请求帮助时，你会非常惊讶于谁会从木制品中出来帮助你。”所以我建议，当你在创业学校的时候，你有机会和这么多人谈论你正在建设的东西，并问他们，“嘿，我可以把你添加到我的更新列表中吗？”随着时间的推移，你会得到数百，甚至数千。

So I would definitely recommend that you start doing that now.

所以我绝对建议你现在就开始这样做。

So to sum  up, I want you to stop thinking about launching as this one moment in time.

所以总而言之，我希望你不要再把发射当做这一时刻来考虑。

 I don't want you to spend all of Startup School getting ready for this one  big day.

我不想让你把创业学校的所有时间都花在为这个重要的一天做准备上。

This one big launch day that you're trying to line up all these  things for.

这是一个重要的发布日，你试图将所有这些东西排成一行。

This is something that is a continuous process that you can do over  the course of the next couple months and into the life cycle of your company.

这是一个连续的过程，您可以在接下来的几个月中完成，并进入公司的生命周期。

 If you didn't catch them the first time, these are all the opportunities that we  went over.

如果你第一次没有抓住他们，这些就是我们讨论过的所有机会。

I'm Kat, so if you ever have any questions...

我是凯特，所以如果你有任何问题.。

Demo day's coming up,  so I might be slightly slower than usual to respond.

演示日快到了，所以我的反应可能会比平时稍微慢一些。

But you can always reach  out to kat@ycombinator.

但你可以随时联系Kat@YCombinator。

I'm also on Twitter.

我也在推特上。

We have 10 minutes for questions, so does  anyone have any questions about launches? Yes.

我们有10分钟的提问时间，有没有人对发射有任何疑问？是。

The red shirt.
Speaker 2:Briefly tell us about launch parties.

红色衬衫。演讲者2：简要介绍一下发射方。

I feel like they've been kind of...

我觉得他们有点.

You know,  people don't think they're as great as they used to be.

你知道，人们不再认为他们像过去那样伟大了。

I was curious about  these being successful events.
Kat Manalac:So the question is, "What do you think about launch parties?" Oh, gosh.

我对这些成功的事件很好奇。Kat Manalac：所以问题是，“你对发射派对有什么看法？”哦，天哪。

I mean,  as an early-stage startup, I wouldn't necessarily recommend you spend a ton of money, right?  Like, back in the day, I don't know...

我的意思是，作为一家初创企业，我不一定会建议你花一大笔钱，对吧？就像以前我不知道.。

I worked at WIRED Magazine right out  of school, and people were spending like tens of thousands of dollars on these elaborate  launch parties and it's bananas.

我一毕业就在“连线”杂志工作，人们在这些精心设计的启动派对上花费了数万美元，这就是香蕉。

I would not recommend anyone do that.

我不建议任何人这样做。

But at the  same time, if you want to have something small, especially if you have a community  and you want to celebrate, sure, why not? But I would not spend a ton  of money on launch parties.

但同时，如果你想拥有一些小东西，特别是如果你有一个社区，你想要庆祝，当然，为什么不呢？但我不会在发射派对上花很多钱。

I wouldn't do it, but I'm not going to stop  you if you want to do something smart and fun.

我不会这么做，但如果你想做一些聪明有趣的事情，我也不会阻止你。

Yes, in the front.
Speaker 3:If you have a problem to solve and need different ideas to solve it, how  do you launch these different ideas?
Kat Manalac:So the question is, "If you have different ideas and you're trying to test out  different ideas or different approaches to solving a problem, how do you recommend launching it?"  You know, I think you could definitely...

是的，在前面。演讲者3：如果你有一个问题要解决，并且需要不同的想法来解决它，你如何启动这些不同的想法？Kat Manalac：所以问题是，“如果你有不同的想法，并且你试图测试不同的想法或解决问题的不同方法，你建议如何启动它？”我觉得你绝对可以.。

Say you have two different ideas and you're  trying to kind of...

假设你有两个不同的想法，你试图.

What industry, just really quick?
Speaker 3:B2B.
Kat Manalac:Okay.

什么行业，真的很快吗？扬声器3：B2B。好的。

So I would say this is a case of like where it's really important  to talk to your users really quickly.

所以我会说，这是一个像这样的情况，它是非常重要的，与您的用户非常快地交谈。

So getting in front of potential customers and  you're launching to not just friends and family, but potential customers and asking them like  what it is they want.

所以，站在潜在客户面前，你不仅要向朋友和家人发起，还要向潜在客户提问，比如他们想要什么。

What approach do they think would help them best? And  getting those...

他们认为什么样的方法对他们最有帮助？得到那些.。

Talking to customers, getting in front of those users as quickly as possible  will help kind of guide which direction to go in.

与客户交谈，尽可能快地站在这些用户的前面，这将有助于引导用户走向哪个方向。

But that is a case  where I definitely think it's better to launch sooner, even just pitching the idea to  your customers.
Speaker 4:Yes.

但在这种情况下，我绝对认为更好的是尽快推出，甚至只是向你的客户推销这个想法。扬声器4：是的。

First of all, thank you very much for the information.

首先，非常感谢你提供的信息。

It’s very, very helpful,  especially...

这非常有帮助特别是.。

In my company, we started a marketing campaign two weeks ago, and we’re getting  really good results.

在我的公司，我们两周前开始了一场营销活动，我们取得了非常好的结果。

But we had some challenges also that you talked about, I can  relate to it.

但我们也遇到了你提到的一些挑战，我能理解。

[inaudible] money [inaudible] talked about it.

[听不见]钱[听不见]谈论过这件事。

I have one question.

我有一个问题。

You mentioned  about launching on Hacker News, what kind of campaigns have better result there? B2B, B2C?  What kind of-
Kat Manalac:Yes.

你提到在黑客新闻上发起，什么样的活动在那里有更好的效果？B2B，B2C？什么样的-Kat Manalac：是的。

That's a good question.

这个问题问得好。

So the question is, "If you were launching on Hacker  News, what types of companies are better suited to launch on Hacker News, B2B, consumer,  dev tools?" So the Hacker News community is a lot of very smart, technical people,  but you would be surprised.

所以问题是，“如果你在Hacker News上发布，哪些类型的公司更适合在Hacker News，B2B，Consumer，Dev Tools上发布？”所以Hacker News社区有很多非常聪明的技术人员，但你会感到惊讶。

So I would recommend you go to...

所以我建议你去.

If you go  to news.ycombinator.com/launches, you can see a list, or even Show HN, and you'll see a  list of all the companies.

如果您转到news.ycompetator.com/Launches，您可以看到一个列表，甚至是Show HN，您将看到所有公司的列表。

/launches will show you a list of all the YC  companies that have launched.

/Launches将显示已启动的所有YC公司的列表。

Show HN is all general companies that have sort of shared  with their building on HN.

显示HN是所有在HN上与其建筑进行某种共享的一般公司。

I think you'd be surprised by which companies get the  most upvotes.

我想你会惊讶于哪些公司获得了最多的赞成票。

So one of the top YC companies of all time that launched on  Hacker News, in terms of upvotes and engagement, was a company called 70 Million Jobs.

因此，在Hacker News上推出的所有YC公司中，就提名率和参与度而言，最好的YC公司之一就是一家名为“7000万个工作岗位”的公司。

 It was a solo, non-technical founder building a company that would help get people who  had criminal records and had previously been in jail connecting them with jobs.

这是一位独立的、非技术的创始人，建立了一家公司，帮助那些有犯罪记录并曾在监狱服刑的人，将他们与工作联系起来。

The community  really loved what the founder was building and asked a lot of questions and were  really, really engaged.

社区非常喜欢创始人正在构建的东西，并且问了很多问题，并且非常投入。

So, when I've asked this question to the Hacker News moderators, they're  like...

所以，当我向黑客新闻主持人问这个问题时，他们就像.

You know, I always thought, sort of before I talked to them, that dev  tools, right? Like, something very technical would do best on Hacker News.

你知道，在我和他们说话之前，我总是想，那个开发工具，对吧？比如，一些非常技术性的东西在黑客新闻上会做得最好。

They said, "That's  absolutely not true.

他们说，“这绝对不是真的。

If you actually look at the numbers, all sorts of companies do  well.".

如果你真的看看这些数字，所有类型的公司都表现得很好。“

But what does really well on Hacker News is really lean leaning into the  intellectual curiosity.

但是真正在Hacker News上做得很好的是真正倾向于知识好奇心的人。

Like, is there something really interesting that you've learned from your users that  you can share with the community? Is there something surprising or that they might not  have heard elsewhere? So that's one recommendation I'd have there is it doesn't matter what  industry you are, but really try to speak to the community in a way that  will kind of connect with them.

比如，你从你的用户那里学到了一些真正有趣的东西，你可以与社区分享吗？是不是有什么令人惊讶的事情，或者他们可能在其他地方没有听说过？所以这是我的一个建议，你是什么行业并不重要，但要真正尝试以一种与他们联系的方式与社区对话。

Then I would look at previous launches that have  done well and see how they've described themselves and how they've kind of teed up  the community to start asking questions.
Speaker 4:And then Reddit, what age range usually you can expect out of that?
Kat Manalac:I really depends.

然后，我会看看之前表现良好的发布，看看他们是如何描述自己的，以及他们是如何让社区开始提出问题的。演讲者4：然后是Reddit，你通常可以预期的年龄范围是多少？Kat Manalac：我真的要看情况。

So what I would recommend with Reddit is that you target a  subreddit that is very specific to...

所以我对Reddit的建议是，你的目标是一个非常具体的subreddit…

So Reddit has a lot, like millions, of different  subreddits on every single topic.

所以Reddit在每个单独的主题上都有很多不同的subreddits，就像数百万个不同的subreddit一样。

So you can find subreddits on TV shows, all the  way to like fitness, and to men's fashion advice, and history buffs.

因此，你可以在电视节目中找到subredits，一路喜欢健身，以及男人的时尚建议和历史爱好者。

So what I  would do is I would figure out what is the subreddit that you want to  target first.

所以我会做的是，我会弄清楚你想首先瞄准的子编辑是什么。

And then the demographics are going to be different depending on what subreddit  you go after.

然后，人口统计将会有所不同，这取决于你追求的是什么子网站。

But of course, on average, it's probably like younger male audience.

但当然，平均而言，它可能像年轻的男性观众。

But  yeah, there are even subreddits that only women are part of, so it really depends.

但是，是的，甚至有只有女性才能加入的子网站，所以这真的要看情况。

 Okay, one more question.

好了，还有一个问题。

In the green.
Speaker 5:What's your advice about launching that home page with very short, very straight points, versus  having a longer page with [inaudible] indicators?
Kat Manalac:Keep it short.

绿色的。演讲者5：与使用[听不到]指示器的较长页面相比，您对启动非常短、非常直截了当的主页有什么建议？Kat Manalac：保持简短。

Yeah.

嗯。

I mean, I think for your landing page, you want it  to be really clear what it is you're building and who it is you're building  for.

我的意思是，我认为对于你的登陆页面，你想让它非常清楚你在构建什么，以及你为谁构建。

But once you start getting into too much detail, I think it can get  muddied or confusing it.

但一旦你开始进入太多的细节，我认为它可能会变得混乱或混淆。

You can certainly add a little bit more detail than just  that, but I would keep copy really tight.

你当然可以添加更多的细节，但我会保持副本非常紧凑。

People's attention spans are really short these  days.

这些天人们的注意力持续时间真的很短。

I think if you can kind of...

我觉得如果你能.

You have a huge community here to  help you A/B Test that messaging and kind of that front page copy.

您在这里有一个巨大的社区来帮助您A/B测试该消息和类似于首页文案。

But I  would recommend to keep it as short and succinct as possible.

但我建议尽可能简短和简洁。

Okay.
