# Tim Brady - Building Culture

Tim Brady:Good morning.

蒂姆·布雷迪：早上好。

My name is Tim Brady.

我叫蒂姆·布雷迪。

I am a partner here at YC, a  group partner.

我是YC的合伙人，集团合伙人。

Which means I work with the companies during the batch closely.

这意味着我在批次期间与公司密切合作。

I have  started three things prior, one of which was Yahoo back in 1994.

我之前已经开始做三件事，其中之一是1994年的雅虎。

So a lot  of what I'm going to talk about today stems from that experience.

所以我今天要讲的很多东西都来自于这段经历。

As Kevin said,  I want to talk about building culture.

正如凯文所说，我想谈谈建设文化。

How to think about it at this stage  of your company and why it's important.

在贵公司的这个阶段如何思考它，以及为什么它很重要。

Now, culture can be pretty broadly defined, so  let me be super clear on what I'm talking about.

现在，文化可以被非常宽泛的定义，所以让我非常清楚我所说的是什么。

Really to me, culture is  just behavior.

对我来说，文化就是行为。

And company culture is that implicit set of behaviors inside of your company.

而公司文化就是你公司内部的一套隐含的行为。

 They should inform your employees on how to behave.

他们应该告诉你的员工如何举止得体。

I guess, when done right, they  should inform the employees inside of your company how to behave when it hasn't been  explicitly laid out for them.

我想，当处理得当时，他们应该告诉公司内部的员工，当公司没有明确地为他们制定计划时，他们应该如何行事。

And the good news, if you do it right, if  you get the right culture, the right behaviors will support a good business, and hopefully  a great business.

好消息是，如果你做得好，如果你有正确的文化，正确的行为将支持一个好的企业，希望是一个伟大的企业。

And over the course of your company, over the history of your  company, it will support that in a lot of intangible ways that are hard even  to describe, but that's why it's important.

在你公司的过程中，在你公司的历史上，它将以很多无形的方式支持这一点，这些方式甚至很难描述，但这就是为什么它很重要。

That's how you should think about it at  this stage.

这就是你在这个阶段应该如何看待它。

Don't over-complicate it.

别太复杂了。

Right? That's really it.

对吗？真的是这样。

So you're probably asking yourselves, at  this stage of the company you have so many things on your plate, you're so  busy, it almost seems like a luxury to be thinking about culture.

所以你可能会问自己，在公司的这个阶段，你有这么多事情要做，你太忙了，思考文化似乎是一种奢侈。

Right? You're not  wrong to be asking that question.

对吗？你问这个问题没有错。

And the reason is that when your company gets  going, these are three phases that you'll be going through as you build your company.

原因是，当你的公司开始运营时，这三个阶段是你建立公司时要经历的三个阶段。

 All of you really are at this top stage that I call the idea stage,  right? Talking to customers, iterating the product, experimenting, iterating the product.

你们所有人真的都在这个顶端阶段，我称之为想法阶段，对吗？与客户交谈，迭代产品，试验，迭代产品。

Hopefully you'll raise some  money at some point to allow you to continue to do that.

希望你能在某个时候筹到一些钱，让你能够继续这样做。

And at some  point in the future, you're going to reach product market fit, right? If you think  back on the product market fit talk that Michael gave a couple of weeks ago.

在未来的某个时候，你会达到产品市场的适合度，对吗？如果你回想一下迈克尔几周前给出的关于产品市场适合度的讨论。

 And when you do that, hopefully you'll raise a whole lot more money and begin  scaling the company.

当你这样做的时候，希望你能筹集到更多的钱，并开始扩大公司规模。

Now scaling the company almost always requires hiring a lot of people,  right? And the people that you have inside of the company prior to hiring a  lot of people are really your cultural DNA.

现在，扩大公司规模几乎总是需要雇佣很多人，对吗？在雇佣很多人之前，你在公司内部的人就是你的文化DNA。

Those are the people that are going  to be involved in hiring and training that next wave of people.

这些人将参与雇佣和培训下一波人。

So it's super  important that you get it right.

所以非常重要的是你要把它弄对。

That's why it is subtitled kind of the first  20 employees that you get.

这就是为什么它的字幕是你得到的前20名员工。

And there's no magic to the number 20, it's really  that set of employees that are in place when you begin scaling the company.

数字20并没有什么神奇之处，当你开始扩大公司规模时，确实有一组员工已经到位。

Because  again, those folks are going to be highly involved in hiring and training this next  wave.

因为再一次，这些人将高度参与下一波的招聘和培训。

So if you get it right, if those first set of employees embody kind  of the culture and the values that you want inside your company, you have a  much higher likelihood of building a strong and coherent culture.

因此，如果你做对了，如果第一批员工体现了你希望公司内部的某种文化和价值观，你就有更高的可能性来建立一个强大而连贯的文化。

The reverse is also true,  right? If you make mistakes, if you get the wrong types of people inside of  the company early on, they're going to be involved in hiring and training.

反之亦然，对吧？如果你犯了错误，如果你很早就在公司内部找到了错误类型的人，他们就会参与招聘和培训。

And those  mistakes are going to get propagated, and it'll be much harder later on to kind  of correct course and try to build a coherent company.

这些错误将会传播开来，以后要想走正确的道路，试图建立一个连贯的公司，将会变得更加困难。

Right? So that's why it's  important to be thinking about now.

对吗？所以这就是为什么现在思考是很重要的。

I know you have a lot on your plate  in starting this company, but what you need to do doesn't take a whole lot  of time.

我知道你在创办这家公司方面有很多事情要做，但你需要做的并不需要花太多时间。

For the most part, it's just some conversations with your co-founder.

在大多数情况下，这只是与你的联合创始人的一些对话。

And so  I came up with a list of six things that you can do now to  help you, or to help the likelihood of you building a strong and coherent culture.

所以我列出了一份清单，列出了你现在可以做的六件事来帮助你，或者帮助你建立一个强大而连贯的文化。

 First one, be proud of the problem you're solving.

第一，为你正在解决的问题感到骄傲。

Kind of seems silly to say.

这么说有点傻。

 But you need to, right? If you don't have the problem yourself, you need to  identify with the people that do have the problem, and you need to be really  proud of the fact that you're solving it for them, right? Because building, as I'm  sure you're going to, if you've heard already, and you'll continue to hear, building a  company's hard.

但你需要，对吧？如果你自己没有问题，你需要认同那些确实有问题的人，你需要为你为他们解决这个问题而感到非常自豪，对吧？因为建设，我相信你会这样做，如果你已经听说了，而且你还会继续听到的话，建立一家公司是很难的。

It's a long process, and there will be some really difficult times.

这是一个漫长的过程，会有一些非常困难的时期。

And  if you're not proud of what you're doing, it's really hard to maintain the level  of energy and enthusiasm you need to sustain the company.

如果你对自己正在做的事情不感到自豪，那么很难保持你维持公司所需的能量和热情水平。

Right? Sometimes where we see  founders go wrong is they choose an idea with their ego.

对吗？有时候，我们看到创始人的错误在于他们用自我选择了一个想法。

They choose an idea  because it sounds good to tell their friends at a party, right? And when times  get tough, it's really hard to maintain that level of energy.

他们选择一个想法是因为在聚会上告诉他们的朋友听起来很好，对吗？当形势变得艰难时，很难保持这样的能量水平。

And the reason energy,  enthusiasm, is important, not just for sustaining the company, but everyone around you will see  how you feel about the company, and to a large degree that will set the  tone for your culture.

能量和热情之所以重要，不仅仅是为了维持公司，而且你周围的每个人都会看到你对公司的感觉，并且在很大程度上这将为你的文化定下基调。

A couple of batches back, we had a YC alum come  and tell his story.

几批回来后，我们有一位YC校友过来讲述他的故事。

He went through the YC program a few years back.

几年前他参加了YC项目。

He  applied with four other guys with the idea of helping retailers liquidate their excess inventory.

他和另外四个人一起申请帮助零售商清理过剩的库存。

 That was the idea they started with.

这就是他们开始时的想法。

And they did all the right things.

他们做了所有正确的事情。

Talked  to customers, iterated, experimented, and he raised some money, and he got to to search  for product market fit, and he continued to to search for product market fit.

与客户交谈，反复，试验，他筹集了一些资金，他得到了搜索产品市场匹配，他继续搜索产品市场匹配。

Ultimately,  they had a good business for a little while, but they also ultimately ended up  in the business of makeup for teenage girls.

最终，他们有一段时间的生意很好，但他们最终也进入了为十几岁的女孩化妆的行业。

Right? They didn't identify with the problem.

对吗？他们没有意识到这个问题。

 And when times got tough, they just didn't want to be there.

当日子变得艰难时，他们就是不想去那里。

Right? They didn't  identify with their customers.

对吗？他们不认同他们的顾客。

And he told the story of where the employees around him,  they actually came up to him and said, hey, it doesn't look like you're enjoying  what you're doing.

他讲了他周围的员工的故事，他们实际上走到他跟前说，嘿，看起来你并不喜欢你所做的事情。

And ultimately they ended up shutting down the company.

最终他们关闭了公司。

Next.

下一个。

When you  do find the right problem to solve, one that you're proud of, create a longterm  vision that others will follow.

当你找到了正确的问题要解决，一个你引以为豪的问题，创造一个长期的愿景，其他人将遵循。

It's much easier to create a great culture if people  who identify with the problem you're solving know you're solving it.

如果认同你正在解决的问题的人知道你正在解决它，那么创造一个伟大的文化就容易得多。

They'll raise their hand  and say, hey, I want to be part of what you're doing.

他们会举起手说，嘿，我想成为你正在做的事情的一部分。

Right? You can  call it a North Star for the company.

对吗？你可以称之为公司的北极星。

And say it in a way that  will inspire people.

并以一种能激励人们的方式说出来。

It should give purpose to the work you're doing.

它应该给你正在做的工作带来目标。

It shouldn't describe  the work, but it should talk about the purpose of that work.

它不应该描述工作，但应该谈论工作的目的。

And let me  give you a couple of examples to illustrate what I mean.

让我举几个例子来说明我的意思。

Tesla.

特斯拉

To accelerate the  world's transition to sustainable energy.

加速世界向可持续能源的转变。

Pretty inspiring, right? No mention of an electric vehicle.

很鼓舞人心，对吧？没有提到电动汽车。

You  know, if you said, oh, we're building the world's best electrical vehicle, that's good.

你知道，如果你说，哦，我们正在建造世界上最好的电动汽车，那很好。

You'll  inspire a handful of engineers who implicitly understand kind of the technical challenges that come  with that.

你将激励一些工程师，他们隐含地理解随之而来的技术挑战。

But if you're going to build a big company, you need to attract  kind of a broad array of people.

但如果你打算建立一个大公司，你需要吸引各种各样的人。

This does that.

这个可以做到这一点。

Another example, Microsoft's original.

另一个例子，微软的原创。

A  computer on every desk in every home.

每家每张桌子上都有一台电脑。

It's kind of laughable now, but in the  early eighties, this was crazy talk, right? Computers were only for businesses and hobbyists.

现在有点可笑，但在80年代初，这是疯狂的谈话，对吧？计算机只适用于企业和业余爱好者。

But  this vision, laid out by Bill Gates and Paul Allen, attracted the right type of  people to their company.

但比尔·盖茨(Bill Gates)和保罗·艾伦(Paul Allen)提出的这一愿景，吸引了合适类型的人加入他们的公司。

Right? The hobbyists that had the capability to help them build  the type of company they needed to build saw this and were excited about it.

对吗？有能力帮助他们建立他们需要建立的公司类型的业余爱好者看到了这一点，并对此感到兴奋。

 It attracted and allowed them to kind of build the type of culture that they  needed at Microsoft.

它吸引并允许他们在某种程度上建立他们在微软需要的文化类型。

Last one.

最后一个。

One you're all familiar with.

一个你们都很熟悉的人。

Organize the world's information and  make it universally accessible and useful.

组织世界上的信息，使其普遍可用和有用。

Again, no mention of the product.

再说一遍，没有提到产品。

Doesn't say we're  building a kick-ass search engine.

并没有说我们正在建立一个非常棒的搜索引擎。

All right.

好的。

So once you're able to come up with  kind of an inspiring vision to attract the right people to your company, the next  thing you should do is have a conversation with your co-founder about the types of  values and behaviors you want to cultivate inside of your company.

所以，一旦你能够想出一个鼓舞人心的愿景来吸引合适的人加入你的公司，你应该做的下一件事就是与你的联合创始人就你希望在公司内部培养的价值观和行为类型进行一次对话。

Right? Ultimately, the purpose  of this at this stage in your company is to use as a filter for  the hiring process.

对吗？最终，在贵公司的这一阶段，此操作的目的是将其用作招聘流程的筛选器。

Right? It should be a short list, and at this stage it's  fine that it's informal.

对吗？这应该是一个短名单，在这个阶段，它是非正式的很好。

If you're lucky enough to to move on and grow, like  ultimately, maybe this list becomes a more polished corporate values list.

如果你足够幸运地继续前进并成长，就像最终，也许这份清单会成为一份更精美的公司价值观清单。

This is probably the  seed of that.

这可能就是那个的种子。

But at this stage, it doesn't need to be polished, right? You  don't need to publish a blog post on it.

但是在这个阶段，它不需要抛光，对吧？你不需要在上面发表博客文章。

It's just a short list.

这只是一个很短的名单。

Less  than five things.

不到五件事。

And this will help you during the hiring process to make sure  that you're letting the right type of people inside the company.

这将帮助你在招聘过程中确保你让正确类型的人进入公司。

Right? This is in  addition to that skill list that you'll need.

对吗？这是对你需要的技能列表的补充。

You know, job description, the skills that  person needs.

你知道，工作描述，人需要的技能。

This is above and beyond that.

这是超越它的。

So let me take you through a  couple of examples.

让我来给你们举几个例子。

And I apologize, these are actually more corporate value lists.

我很抱歉，这些实际上是更多的公司价值清单。

They're a  little more polished.

它们稍微擦亮了一点。

Yours won't need to be this polished.

你的不需要这么擦亮。

All right.

好的。

Spotify.

Spotify

Innovative, collaborative,  sincere, passionate, and playful.

创新，协作，真诚，热情，好玩。

Right? You can see pretty clearly how you can use that  set of lists that this lists to begin screening potential employees.

对吗？您可以非常清楚地看到如何使用该列表集开始筛选潜在员工。

Atlassian.

亚特兰大。

Right? This is  a little different, the way they make the list.

对吗？这是一个有点不同的方式，他们的名单。

It doesn't have to be just  adjectives like the Spotify one was.

它不必像Spotify那样只是形容词。

Open company, no bullshit.

开放公司，不要胡说八道。

Build with heart and balance.

用心和平衡来建设。

 Don't fuck with the customer.

别他妈的和顾客在一起。

Play as a team.

作为一个团队踢球。

And be the change you seek.

成为你所寻求的改变。

 Right? They said it a little different.

对吗？他们说的有点不同。

You can see how this came from a  conversation between co-founders, right? Like I don't want to work in an environment that's highly  political.

你可以看到这是如何从联合创始人之间的对话中得出的，对吧？就像我不想在高度政治化的环境中工作。

No bullshit.

不是胡说八道。

Right? That translates into kind of a hiring filter of just like  if someone seems political in any way, let's not let them in the company, him  or her in the company.

对吗？这就转化为一种招聘过滤，就像如果某人看起来有任何政治色彩，我们就不要让他们进入公司，让他或她进入公司。

So come up with this list.

所以想出这张清单。

Right? Again, a short  list.

对吗？再说一遍，一个简短的名单。

What type of company do you want to build? What type of behaviors will  support the business you're building? And then create that list.

你想建立什么样的公司？什么类型的行为将支持您正在构建的业务？然后创建该列表。

But don't let it just  be a piece of paper.

但不要让它只是一张纸。

Right? Don't put it in a drawer and wait for  the marketing department to polish it a few years later.

对吗？不要把它放在抽屉里，等着营销部门在几年后擦亮它。

You have to model that  behavior.

你必须模仿这种行为。

For better, for worse, the early employees will look to you for the cultural  cues, right? You can't say, do as I say, not as I do.

无论是好是坏，早期的员工都会向你寻求文化暗示，对吗？你不能说，做我说的，而不是我做的。

Right? You  have to walk the walk.

对吗？你必须走自己的路。

They will take their cues from you.

他们会从你那里得到提示。

Four.

四。

When thinking  about this list, to the extent you can, make sure it's externally focused.

当考虑这个清单的时候，尽量确保它是外在的。

It's much  better to build a culture that's focused on the customer than it is on how  you treat one another inside the company.

建立一种以客户为中心的文化，而不是在公司内部如何对待他人，这要好得多。

Look, your shortlist can have both.

听着，你的入围名单可以两者兼得。

But the  more important ones are having it externally focused.

但更重要的是让它专注于外部。

Over the long haul, that will serve  you much, much better.

从长远来看，这将为你提供更好的服务。

And let me give you an example of of what I  mean by this.

让我给你们举个例子来说明我的意思。

So, move fast and break things.

所以，动作要快，要打破东西。

You've heard this right? Facebook.

你听过这个对吗？脸谱。

This  is what I consider an internally focused thing.

这就是我所认为的专注于内部的事情。

If you're a project manager or an  engineer at Facebook trying to decide what to do next, this doesn't offer you a  whole lot of guidance, right? Think back to kind of the definition I gave of  company culture, right? It informs employees how to behave when it hasn't been explicitly laid  out.

如果你是Facebook的项目经理或工程师，试图决定下一步做什么，这不会给你提供很多指导，对吧？回想一下我对公司文化的定义，对吧？它告知员工如何在没有明确规划的情况下如何行事。

If you're deciding what next product to build, this doesn't help at all.

如果你在决定下一步要构建什么产品，这一点帮助都没有。

It  just tells you to move fast, right? Shouldn't be a surprise when you look at  this that some of the privacy violations that they've been charged with have occurred at  Facebook, right? I don't think for a second anyone at Facebook set out to violate  anyone's privacy, but their culture certainly didn't help them, didn't give them the guide rails  on where to stop.

它只是告诉你动作要快，对吧？当你看到他们被指控的一些侵犯隐私的行为发生在Facebook上时，你不应该感到惊讶，对吧？我不认为Facebook上的任何人会侵犯任何人的隐私，但他们的文化肯定没有帮助他们，没有给他们关于停在哪里的导轨。

Right? Contrast that with kind of Google's early motto.

对吗？这与谷歌早期的座右铭形成了对比。

Don't be  evil.

别做坏事。

Not particularly prescriptive necessarily, but it's outwardly focused, right? It lets the employees and  the world know, hey, we're, we're a force for good.

不一定是特别规定的，但它是外在的，对吗？它让员工和全世界都知道，嘿，我们是一支为善的力量。

And when you think about  kind of that policy that Google has with its engineers, they're allowed to work 20%  of their time on these independent projects.

当你想到谷歌和它的工程师们的政策时，他们被允许把20%的时间花在这些独立的项目上。

It's pretty impressive that you haven't heard of  any of those go astray.

令人印象深刻的是，你没有听说过其中任何一个误入歧途。

Right? Pretty amazing, given the data they're sitting on.

对吗？非常令人惊讶，考虑到他们坐在上面的数据。

Again,  outwardly focused, right? It gives some guide rails to the employees on how to behave.

再一次，向外聚焦，对吗？它为员工提供了一些关于如何行为的指南。

 Next.

下一个。

Have a conversation about diversity.

进行一次关于多样性的对话。

And I'm not just talking about ethnic and gender  diversity here.

我不只是在这里谈论种族和性别多样性。

I'm talking about a diversity of opinions.

我说的是不同的观点。

Can you create a culture where  people with diametrically opposed opinions, strongly held, can coexist? Can you foster conversations that are  loud, but then people walk away and are, okay? How important is that to your  business? There's plenty of research out there that suggests that companies that are able to  foster this type of environment, have a diverse environment, that isn't always agreeable, tend to  be more creative.

你能创造出一种文化，在这种文化中，持有截然相反观点的人可以共存吗？你能培养大声的对话吗，然后人们就走开了，好吗？这对你的生意有多重要？有大量的研究表明，能够培育这种环境的公司，有一个多样化的环境，并不总是令人愉快的，往往更有创造力。

They tend to be better problem solvers.

他们往往是更好的问题解决者。

And the reason I put  this up there is it's really hard, because most of the advice when you get  going, when you're hiring the first set of employees is to, hey, tap your Rolodex,  talk to friends, talk to former colleagues, right? Those people you know whether or not  they're good engineers, you know whether or not they embody the values that you're trying  to put into your company.

我把这个放在那里的原因是它真的很难，因为当你开始，当你雇佣第一批员工的时候，大多数的建议是，嘿，点击你的Rolodex，和朋友聊天，和以前的同事聊天，对吗？那些你知道他们是否是好工程师的人，你知道他们是否体现了你试图给你的公司带来的价值观。

They're known quantities.

它们是已知数量。

And at that stage it's a good  thing.

在那个阶段，这是一件好事。

But there are also probably a lot like you, right? And you can find  pretty quickly that you've built a pretty homogeneous environment in trying to hire too quickly.

但也可能有很多像你一样的人，对吧？而且你很快就会发现，你已经建立了一个非常同质的环境，试图过快地招聘。

 So have this conversation.

这段对话也是如此。

How important is it to you, to your company, to have  diversity? Because if you think you're going to wake up at a hundred employees and  then start a diversity program, you're fooling yourself.

多样性对你，对你的公司来说有多重要？因为如果你认为你会在一百名员工中醒来，然后开始一个多元化计划，你是在愚弄自己。

It's way too hard.

太难了。

It's too late  by then.

到时候已经太晚了。

So have that conversation.

那次谈话也是如此。

It's tough.

这很难。

I don't have the right answers on  what that looks like.

我对那看起来像什么没有正确的答案。

But have it, it's important.

但是拥有它，这很重要。

So once you've done all that,  had those conversations, put a hiring plan in place.

所以，一旦你完成了所有这些，进行了这些谈话，就把招聘计划放在适当的位置。

Right? Don't just let it happen.

对吗？别让它发生。

 From the very first employee, make sure you're following a process.

从第一个员工开始，确保你遵循的是一个流程。

There's a ton of  stuff online about hiring processes beyond the scope of this talk, but consider all those  conversations you had with your co-founder, the type of values you're trying to instill in  the company, and the type of diversity you want, and make sure that's part of  the process from day one.

网上有很多关于招聘流程的内容超出了本文的讨论范围，但请考虑一下你与联合创始人的所有谈话，你试图向公司灌输的价值观类型，以及你想要的多样性类型，并确保这是从第一天起就是过程的一部分。

Right? And make sure you assess whether it's working, especially  the early employees.

对吗？并且确保你评估它是否有效，特别是早期员工。

Right? After you hire your first couple of people, make sure you  get back together with your co-founder a month or two after and discuss whether it  did what it should have.

对吗？在你雇佣了最初的几个人之后，确保一两个月后你和你的联合创始人重归于好，并讨论它是否做了它应该做的事情。

Did it filter the right way? Do you have the  right type of people in your company at this point? And if it didn't work  well, improve it.

它过滤的方式正确吗？在这一点上，你的公司有合适的人吗？如果效果不好，改进它。

Plan on evolving it.

计划发展它。

Right? You want it tested by the time  you get to the point where you have to scale fast.

对吗？您希望在达到必须快速扩展的点之前对其进行测试。

Right? You want a  process that you know works by then.

对吗？你想要一个你知道在那时起作用的过程。

So that's it.

所以就这样了。

Right? Again, not too early.

对吗？再说一遍，不要太早。

 You have a ton on your plate.

你有很多事要做。

And, again, what I've given you, hopefully, are  just a few simple things that aren't too time consuming.

而且，再一次，我希望我给你的只是一些不太耗时的简单事情。

Just conversations you can have,  kind of thought experiments, with your co-founder that can help kind of build a solid  foundation for building a culture later on.

你可以和你的联合创始人进行一种思想实验的对话，这可以帮助你为以后的文化建设打下坚实的基础。

Thanks everyone.


谢谢大家。
