# Adora Cheung - How to Prioritize Your Time

Adora Cheung:Hello, as Kevin said, my name is Adora.

张多拉：你好，正如凯文所说，我的名字是阿多拉。

I'm one of the partners at YC  and I'm going to talk about how to prioritize time.

我是YC的合伙人之一，我将讨论如何区分时间的优先顺序。

Time as you know is  precious, especially when you're working on a startup.

正如你所知道的，时间是宝贵的，特别是当你在创业公司工作的时候。

Time burns money and money is the  very basic thing that keeps a startup alive.

时间烧钱，钱是创业公司赖以生存的最基本的东西。

Not to be too philosophical about it,  but even if your personal burn is super low, you can eat ramen days on  end, which I don't suggest and you don't have to pay yourself for a very  long time.

不是太哲理，但即使你的个人烧伤是超低，你可以吃拉面天结束，这我不建议，你不必支付自己很长一段时间。

There's always a high opportunity cost to doing your startup, so it's super  important to use your time the best way possible to maximize your startup's chance for  success.

创业总是有很高的机会成本，所以用最好的方式利用你的时间来最大化你的创业成功的机会是非常重要的。

Which means you need to be really good at identifying and prioritizing tasks that  are going to be the most impactful for your startup's progress, which I've noticed after  going through thousands of weekly updates from startup school founders that a lot of founders  are not doing this well.

这意味着你需要非常善于识别和优先处理对你的创业进展最有影响的任务，我在查看了创业学校创始人每周数千次的更新后注意到，很多创始人在这方面做得并不好。

So hopefully this will be helpful.

所以希望这会有所帮助。

Let me first pre-face  all of this by defining what time I'm talking about.

首先，让我通过定义我所谈论的时间来预先面对所有这一切。

So obviously there are 24  hours in a day and I'm not here to tell you how to allocate those  hours across your startup versus everything else that is important to you.

所以很明显，一天有24个小时，我不是来告诉你如何在你的创业公司中分配这些时间，而不是告诉你其他对你来说很重要的事情。

Sleep, family, friends,  hobbies and so on and so forth.

睡眠，家人，朋友，爱好等等。

Everyone has different situations, so it's hard for  me to, from up here, give you a good generic advice on how to allocate  your time across these things.

每个人都有不同的情况，所以我很难，从这里，就如何分配你的时间在这些事情上给你一个好的一般性建议。

I'm just going to assume you're doing what's best for  you, whether it's two, six, 12 hours a day that you decide to work on  your startup.

我只是假设你正在做对你自己最好的事情，无论你决定每天工作两个小时，六个小时，还是12个小时。

It doesn't matter to me, for the purpose of this lecture.

这对我来说并不重要，为了这个讲座的目的。

I just  want to help you figure out how to spend those two, six or 12 hours  that you've decided to allocate your startup in the best possible way.

我只是想帮你弄清楚如何度过这两个小时，六个小时或12个小时，你决定以最好的方式分配你的创业公司。

All right, so  when it comes to things to work on your startup, my guess is that you  already have something like a task list in which you put new ideas to eventually  work on and you update that very frequently.

好的，所以当谈到创业公司的工作时，我的猜测是你已经有了类似于任务列表的东西，你把新的想法放在其中最终工作，并且你非常频繁地更新它。

So let's start from there, that you  have a task list of things to do.

所以让我们从这里开始，你有一个任务清单要做的事情。

First, I want to make a real  clear distinction between real and fake startup progress.

首先，我想明确区分真正的和虚假的创业进程。

This is the easiest way to classify  whether a task goes into the should do or the should not do bucket.

这是将任务分类到应该做还是不应该做存储桶中的最简单的方法。

If  it contributes to real startup progress, you should consider doing it, and if it doesn't,  then don't.

如果它有助于真正的创业进展，你应该考虑这样做，如果没有，那就不要做。

This seems trivial at first.

这一开始似乎微不足道。

Why would anyone do anything that amounts to  fake startup progress? But let me explain further.

为什么会有人做任何相当于伪造初创公司进展的事情？但让我进一步解释。

So real startup progress is when you're  really focused on things that really move the needle for your startup and in the  beginning, the best way to show this is through growth, in particular growth of your  primary KPI.

所以真正的创业进展是当你真正专注于真正推动创业的事情，并且在开始的时候，最好的方式来表明这一点是通过增长，特别是你的主要KPI的增长。

I gave a whole lecture on this a few weeks ago on KPI  and goals.

几周前，我就KPI和目标做了一次完整的演讲。

If you haven't watched it yet, please watch it.

如果你还没有看过，请看。

I talk a lot  about primary and secondary KPIs.

我谈论了很多关于主要和次要KPI的内容。

There's always a balance between what to focus on.

在关注什么之间总是有一个平衡。

But  for the purpose of this lecture, I'm just going to refer to the primary KPI  as a thing to focus on growing.

但是为了这个讲座的目的，我只是将主要的KPI作为一个重点放在成长上。

So to summarize, your primary KPI almost always  is either revenue or active users and you should always be setting weekly goals for  this.

因此，总而言之，您的主要KPI几乎总是收入或活跃用户，您应该始终为此设定每周目标。

To move the needle on the KPIs, the highest leverage thing you can be  doing always comes in the form of tasks that involve talking to users and building  and iterating your product.

要移动KPI上的指针，您可以做的最高杠杆的事情总是以任务的形式出现，这些任务涉及到与用户对话以及构建和迭代您的产品。

Nothing else.

没别的了。

This is in direct contrast with fake startup progress,  which is when founders focus on things that are not directly related to growing your  primary KPI.

这与虚假的创业进度形成了直接的对比，即创始人专注于与你的主要KPI增长没有直接关系的事情。

So common things I see in weekly updates are things like attending conferences,  focusing on winning awards.

所以我在每周更新中看到的常见事情是参加会议，专注于赢得奖项。

Now [inaudible 00:03:40], optimizing the wrong metrics.

现在[Inaudible 00：03：40]，优化了错误的指标。

While you may convince  yourself these are good things to focus on, there are actually many steps away from  delivering real value to your customer.

虽然你可能会说服自己这些都是值得关注的好事情，但实际上离为客户提供真正的价值还有很长的一段路要走。

And so if all the things you could be  possibly doing, spending any significant time on any of these things is almost always a  bad idea.

因此，如果你可能正在做的所有事情，在这些事情上花费任何重要的时间几乎都不是一个好主意。

The goal is not to optimize startup vanity, but actually delivering value to  your customer.

我们的目标不是优化初创企业的虚荣心，而是真正为客户提供价值。

Doing the things that will help you directly help you increase your KPI.

做那些对你有帮助的事情直接帮助你提高你的KPI。

 Now that we have one way to filter what tasks you should be working on,  let's go a little bit deeper and figure out how to determine if you're prioritizing  the right tasks.

现在我们有了一种方法来筛选您应该处理的任务，让我们深入了解一下如何确定您是否对正确的任务进行了优先排序。

This at first also seems trivial.

这一点乍看起来也是微不足道的。

Presumably you're doing what you believe  is high value work.

想必你正在做你认为是高价值的工作。

I mean, nobody ever says, "Oh, let me do the thing  that is going to help my startup the least." Right? But that's what I'm going  to challenge.

我的意思是，没有人会说，“哦，让我做对我的初创公司帮助最小的事情吧。”对吗？但这就是我要挑战的。

There are hundreds of things you could be possibly working on to increase  your primary KPI.

有数以百计的事情，你可能正在工作，以增加您的主要KPI。

Is what you're working on right now, the best thing you can  do to meet your weekly goal? Or have you tricked yourself into doing something else?  The reason I'm skeptical is because it's actually quite easy for a low value work  to unnoticeably, creep into your schedule.

你现在正在做的是你能做的最好的事情来达到你的每周目标吗？还是你欺骗自己做了其他的事情？我持怀疑态度的原因是，一项低价值的工作实际上很容易不知不觉地进入你的日程安排。

And it actually takes a lot of work and  effort to not let this happen.

实际上，要想不让这种情况发生，需要付出大量的工作和努力。

So here's an experiment.

所以这里有一个实验。

Try journaling in great detail  of each day in the past week, every single hour, so hour by hour, what  is it that you were exactly doing? And be honest on what you thought the  impact was before you actually did it and what it was in increasing your primary  KPI.

试着详细地记录过去一周中的每一天，每一个小时，所以一个小时，你到底在做什么？诚实地说，在你真正做之前，你认为影响是什么，以及它在提高你的主要KPI方面是什么。

I think you'll be surprised by how much of it was actually low value  work.

我想你会惊讶于其中有多少实际上是低价值的工作。

And the reason is not because you're lazy or I hope not.

原因不是因为你懒惰或者我希望不是。

It's more  because we tend to be as humans on autopilot.

更多的是因为我们倾向于成为自动驾驶仪上的人类。

So we don't give much thought  to what we're doing with our time.

所以我们没有太多考虑我们在用我们的时间做什么。

And our natural instinct is actually to go  for low value work because it's usually the easiest and quickest thing to accomplish.

我们的本能实际上是去做低价值的工作，因为这通常是最容易和最快完成的事情。

And  it fulfills our desires to check as many things off of a list as possible,  it feels really good to check things off.

而且它满足了我们的愿望，尽可能多地检查清单上的事情，检查事情的感觉真的很好。

But once you're aware of this, preventing  it is actually quite simple, but it does take time, thought and discipline.

但是一旦你意识到这一点，防止它实际上是非常简单的，但它确实需要时间，思想和纪律。

So first,  if you aren't already, you should keep a spreadsheet of ideas that can move your  primary KPI and not to be too repetitive, but these tasks are almost always a  variant of two things, right? One, talking to users and two, building product.

所以，首先，如果你还没有，你应该保持一个想法的电子表格，可以移动你的主要KPI，不要太重复，但这些任务几乎总是两件事的变体，对吗？一是与用户交谈，二是构建产品。

Talking to  users helps you with three things, right? It converts them into customers and revenue or  helps you convert them into customers and revenue.

与用户交谈可以帮助您做三件事，对吧？它可以将它们转换为客户和收入，或者帮助您将它们转换为客户和收入。

It helps you understand if you're on  the right track or not, and It helps you figure out your product roadmap.

它帮助您了解您是否走上了正确的道路，并帮助您确定您的产品路线图。

And  then building product actually delivers a solution to the user to see if it actually  translates into more customers in revenue.

然后构建产品实际上向用户提供了一个解决方案，看看它是否真的能转化为更多的客户收入。

So as you come up with these ideas, you  should log them into your spreadsheet and keep doing that as every idea you get.

因此，当你想出这些想法时，你应该把它们记录到你的电子表格中，并继续这样做，作为你得到的每一个想法。

 But the key is don't do them right away.

但关键是不要马上做。

Just write them down.

把它们写下来。

And this  is important because always switching to the thing you just thought of, which always sounds  better now than later causes a ton of whiplash for founders and it's the primary  culprit in making no progress during the week.

这一点很重要，因为总是切换到你刚刚想到的东西，现在听起来总是比以后听起来更好，这会给创始人带来大量的鞭笞，这也是一周内没有进展的主要罪魁祸首。

So now you're tracking this list.

所以现在你在追踪这个名单。

Then  once we go through each item in your spreadsheet and grade the new and regrade  the old items based on how impactful you think the task would be on achieving  the weekly goal for your primary KPI.

然后，一旦我们检查了您的电子表格中的每个项目，并根据您认为任务对实现主要KPI的每周目标的影响程度，对新的和旧的项目进行分级。

There are three grades you can give to  each task on your list.

对于清单上的每项任务，你可以给出三个等级。

High, medium, low.

高，中，低。

These definitions are a little arbitrary in  the sense that it's all relative to whatever else is on your list, but in  general, high means that's a task you believe that will help you meet your goal  for the week.

这些定义有点武断，因为它与你清单上的其他任何东西都是相对的，但总的来说，高意味着你相信这是一项能帮助你实现一周目标的任务。

With high probability a medium is you're not sure but with okay  probability you can hit your weekly goal and low is with very low probability.

在高概率情况下，中等概率是你不确定，但如果概率不错，你可以达到每周的目标，而低概率是非常低的概率。

You'll  see that it's actually pretty easy to figure out what those low and high value  tasks are when you compare them against everything else you could be doing.

你会发现，当你将那些低价值和高价值的任务与你可以做的其他事情进行比较时，实际上很容易弄清楚它们是什么。

Which is  why this exercise, no matter how pedantic it is, is important to do.

这就是为什么这个练习，无论多么迂腐，都是很重要的。

So let  me go through an example.

让我来看一个例子。

Let's say I am a founder of a SAS software,  generic SAS software company and I just kind of launched it.

假设我是一家SAS软件公司的创始人，通用SAS软件公司，我刚刚推出了它。

My goal for the  next week is just to get five new paying customers.

我下周的目标就是得到五个新的付费客户。

So here's just a sliver  of things I can do to reach that goal.

所以这里只有一小部分我可以做的事情来达到这个目标。

At the top you'll see that  the most impactful thing I can do is go to the offices of 10 potential  customers who were actually intro'd to me by friends or whoever, and I know that  if I show up to the office, just from experience, I have a very good  chance of convincing them to buy my product.

在顶端，你会看到我能做的最有影响力的事情就是去10个潜在客户的办公室，他们实际上是由朋友或任何人介绍给我的，我知道如果我出现在办公室，仅凭经验，我就有很好的机会说服他们购买我的产品。

And so that's why that's at the  top of the list.

这就是为什么这是第一位的原因。

The next few are of medium impact because they involve me  filling up my pipeline, which is one step away from landing new customers but necessary  to do.

接下来的几个是中等影响，因为它们涉及我填满我的管道，这距离获得新客户只有一步之遥，但这是必要的。

I also have the second thing here.

我这里还有第二件事。

I also have video demos I  can do, which for me aren't as effective as doing in person but worth doing  as well because they do lead to some new customers.

我还可以做视频演示，对我来说，这不像当面做的那么有效，但值得做得更好，因为它们确实会带来一些新客户。

You'll notice that there are  a couple items at the bottom of this which involve programming.

您会注意到，在这篇文章的底部有几个项目涉及编程。

So a very common  mistake technical founders make is to build things first and then go talk to users.

因此，技术创建者犯的一个非常常见的错误是先构建东西，然后再与用户交谈。

 And according to this list to meet my weekly goal, this means they would be  choosing the least impactful thing to do for that week.

根据这个清单来实现我的每周目标，这意味着他们将选择在那一周做的影响最小的事情。

But with this method, if  they're honest about it, they have no choice but to get off their butt and  go talk to users instead.

但使用这种方法，如果他们诚实，他们别无选择，只能离开他们的屁股，去与用户交谈。

So along with the impact that it may have on  helping you achieve your weekly goal, we also need to consider a second dimension of  how complex the task is.

因此，除了它可能对帮助您实现每周目标产生的影响之外，我们还需要考虑任务有多复杂的第二个维度。

That is, how long would it take for you and  your team to complete it? Because there are mini tasks within each category of impact.

也就是说，你和你的团队需要多长时间来完成它？因为在每个影响类别中都有小型任务。

 For example, there's like four of here in medium and three in low.

例如，这里有四个中等的，三个低的。

And so  the question is how do I stack rank those within that category.

因此，问题是如何对该类别中的那些进行堆叠排序。

And so this  dimension of complexity helps.

所以这个维度的复杂性是有帮助的。

So we can [inaudible] complexity in three ways.

因此，我们可以在三个方面[听不到]复杂性。

Easy, medium and  hard.

容易，中等和困难。

An easy task is something that you can do in less than a day.

简单的任务是你可以在不到一天的时间内完成的事情。

 That means you can do a bunch of easy tasks [inaudible] today.

这意味着你今天可以做一堆简单的任务[听不见]。

A medium task  is something that takes one or two days for you to do.

中等任务是指你需要一到两天才能完成的事情。

And a hard  task is one that takes many days to do and you may not complete it  within the week.

一项艰巨的任务需要很多天才能完成，你可能无法在一周内完成它。

So once you go grade all of them, you'll have again the  second dimension here where you have impact and then also complexity.

所以一旦你给所有这些东西打分，你又会有第二个维度，在这里你会产生影响，然后也会变得复杂。

And so now you  can easily stack rank all the tasks on your list, and it's pretty easy to  choose what you should prioritize.

因此，现在您可以轻松地对列表中的所有任务进行堆叠排序，并且很容易选择您应该优先排序的任务。

So given, the directive is to hit your weekly goal,  the obvious choice is always to go for the combos of high easy combos and  high medium that is something attached that has high impact and is easy to do.

所以给定，指令是达到你的每周目标，显而易见的选择总是去高容易的组合和高中，这是一些附加的东西，有很高的影响，很容易做到的东西。

 You should always do those first and then go to high impact and medium complexity.

你应该总是先做这些，然后去高影响和中等复杂性。

 And what you really don't want to do is focus on these bottom things here,  right? Something that has probably very low probability in helping you achieve your goal and  is very hard to do, takes a long time to do.

而你真正不想做的是关注这些底层的事情，对吗？一些可能在帮助你实现目标的概率很低并且很难做到的事情，需要很长的时间去做。

There's really no point  in doing any of those things.

做这些事情真的没有任何意义。

So just as important as selecting the right tasks  to work on is making sure you don't try to do everything at once.

因此，与选择正确的工作任务同样重要的是确保你不会试图一次完成所有事情。

Pick  enough tasks that you can complete and do well.

选择足够的任务，你可以完成并且做得很好。

Doing too many things means you  won't be able to complete much of the tasks with much conviction and makes it  really hard to show progress from week to week.

做太多的事情意味着你不能以坚定的信念完成大部分任务，并且让你很难一周又一周地展示进步。

How do I know I am  prioritizing my time well? Ultimately, you know you've done well if you're hitting your weekly  goals consistently.

我怎么知道我是不是很好地安排了我的时间？归根结底，如果你坚持实现每周目标，你就知道你已经做得很好了。

So you're doing well if your graphs look like that.

所以如果你的图表看起来像这样，你做得很好。

Sadly, most of  us have graphs that look like this.

可悲的是，我们大多数人都有这样的图表。

These troughs of sorrow where it's decreasing and  you're kind of like stable for a while at the bottom.

这些悲伤的低谷，在那里它正在减少，你就像是在底部稳定了一段时间。

That's when you start  doubting yourself as like, "Am I working really on the right thing or not?" And  so what can we do about this? Or how do we know? So one way  is to do what you're already doing in startup school, which is writing weekly updates  and being really consistent and honest about it.

这时你开始怀疑自己，就像“我真的在做正确的事情吗？”那么我们能做些什么呢？或者我们怎么知道？因此，一种方法是做你在创业学校已经在做的事情，也就是每周更新一次，并对此保持一致和诚实。

So the key components of weekly update  is pretty straight forward.

所以每周更新的关键组成部分是相当直接的。

What was your weekly goal? Did you succeed? If not, what  was the biggest blocker of the growth? What did you do and what was the  predicted impact and what was the actual impact and what did you learn this week?  What were the big learnings this week? And then by doing an ongoing evaluation of  your weekly updates, it will help you improve how you select and prioritize tasks.

你每周的目标是什么？你成功了吗？如果不是，什么是增长的最大阻碍因素？你做了什么，预计的影响是什么，实际的影响是什么，这周你学到了什么？这周最大的收获是什么？然后，通过对每周更新进行持续评估，它将帮助您改进选择任务和确定任务优先级的方式。

Once  in a while you should review all your weekly updates, like from beginning the first  one you ever wrote for your startup to the current one, to the last one.

偶尔你应该检查一下你的每周更新，比如从你为创业公司写的第一个更新开始，到现在的更新，再到最后一个。

 And check for things like, do you feel like you're learning fast enough? Are you  predicting the impact of each task well? Did you let low value work or even  worse, fake progress creep into your schedule? Is your biggest blocker the same thing for  every week? A lot of people actually get in a rough spot where they're not  learning anything new and just doing the same thing over and over without realizing it.

检查一下，你觉得你的学习速度够快吗？你能很好地预测每个任务的影响吗？你有没有让低价值的工作，甚至更糟糕的，虚假的进度悄悄进入你的日程？你最大的阻断者是不是每周都是一样的？很多人实际上陷入了一个艰难的境地，他们没有学习任何新的东西，只是一遍又一遍地做同样的事情，而没有意识到这一点。

 Reviewing your updates will help you realize that and will force you to try to  get yourself out of bad loop.

审查你的更新将帮助你认识到这一点，并将迫使你试图让自己走出糟糕的循环。

In terms, this last one, in terms of completing  tasks, if you're finding yourself always running out of time to complete tasks, you felt  was totally possible to complete in the week, I have two suggestions for you.

在最后一个方面，就完成任务而言，如果你发现自己总是没有时间完成任务，你觉得完全有可能在一周内完成，我有两个建议给你。

One  is perhaps your task is actually too complex and you should break it down into  medium and easy tasks.

一个可能是你的任务实际上太复杂了，你应该把它分成中等和简单的任务。

The second one is, maybe it is that your schedule needs  to be rejiggered a little bit.

第二个是，也许是你的日程需要稍微调整一下。

I recommend a modified version of what we call  the maker's manager schedule, which was popularized by Paul Graham, the essay is linked in  the startup school library.

我推荐一个我们称为制造者的经理进度表的修改版本，它是由Paul Graham推广的，这篇文章链接在创业学校图书馆。

The basic idea is this, there are high context switching costs  to different types of tasks.

其基本思想是，对于不同类型的任务，存在较高的上下文切换成本。

For example, coding and meetings, like talking to users.

例如，编码和会议，比如与用户交谈。

Meaning  it's hard to restart and ramp back up on a task, especially like coding and  it's costly to exit at a time when things are finally flowing and you're getting  stuff done.

这意味着很难重新启动和重新开始一项任务，特别是像编码这样的任务，而且在事情终于顺利完成的时候，退出的成本也很高。

So if you find yourself switching back and forth too much, it may  be that you're wasting time and need to rejigger things so you have a continuous  chunk of time devoted to each one.

因此，如果你发现自己来回切换太多，可能是你在浪费时间，需要重新调整事情，这样你就有了连续的时间专注于每一件事。

So many people will actually divide their week  into days, right? So one full day they'll just spend coding and the next full  day they'll spend meetings and talking to users and so forth.

所以很多人会把一周分成几天，对吗？因此，一整天他们只会花在编码上，第二天他们会花在会议和与用户交谈上，诸如此类。

Instead of me having  like one hour here, one hour there, one hour there.

而不是我在这里一个小时，那里一个小时。

For people who need to  get more stuff done in the day, then they'll do half the day they'll spend  coding and the half the day they'll spend talking to users.

对于那些需要在一天内完成更多事情的人来说，他们会花半天时间编写代码，半天时间花在与用户交谈上。

So this is, for  any solo founders out there.

所以，对于任何一个单独的创建者来说都是如此。

This is incredibly important for you because you don't have  the opportunity to divvy up the work across multiple people.

这对你来说非常重要，因为你没有机会把工作分配给多个人。

So it's really important to  get your schedule correct.

所以把你的日程安排好真的很重要。

All right, so I'll end with one final piece of advice,  which is moving fast.

好的，所以我将以最后一条建议结束，这条建议进展得很快。

So in the beginning of your startup, your primary objective is  to move as quickly as possible to prove that you're building something people want.

因此，在创业之初，你的主要目标是尽快行动，以证明你正在建造人们想要的东西。

The  faster you figure this out, the faster you can pivot into something or have the  confidence that you have product market fit and can start scaling and building a tremendous  business.

你越快意识到这一点，你就能更快地转向某些东西，或者有信心你有产品市场适合，可以开始扩展和建立一个巨大的业务。

So making decisions thoughtfully and quickly is super important.

因此，深思熟虑、迅速做出决定是极其重要的。

Time is often wasted in  indecisiveness.

时间常常浪费在犹豫不决中。

The key is to be okay with making a wrong choice and learning fast.

关键是要接受错误的选择和快速的学习。

 So of course choosing the right thing to do at the get go is the  best thing possible.

所以，当然，在一开始就选择正确的事情是可能的最好的事情。

But it's also the case that a person who chooses the wrong  task to work on today but moves quickly, learns why it's wrong and moves to  the right one is a better off than the person that takes forever to choose  the right tasks to work on and as twiddling their thumbs working on low value  stuff in the meantime, that's all I have today on how to prioritize time to  summarize what you should be doing.

但也有这样一种情况，一个人今天选择了错误的任务去工作，但行动迅速，了解了它为什么是错误的，然后转移到正确的任务上，比那些永远都在选择正确的任务进行工作的人要好得多，在此期间，他们在低价值的工作上游手好闲，这就是我今天关于如何安排时间优先总结你应该做的事情的全部内容。

Always be working on things that directly impact your  primary KPI.

始终致力于直接影响您的主要KPI的事情。

Do the things that have the highest impact to meeting your weekly goal.

做那些对你每周目标有最大影响的事情。

 And that usually always means what? Talking to users and building product.

这通常意味着什么？与用户交谈并构建产品。

Any questions?
Speaker 2:What do you think about using OKRs at this stage?
Adora:So the question is what do I think about using OKRs.

有问题吗？演讲者2：你对现阶段使用OKR有什么看法？阿多拉：所以问题是我对使用OKR有什么看法。

I think the concept  of OKRs is good.

我认为OKR的概念是好的。

Meaning you have key objectives and then tasks.

这意味着你有关键的目标，然后是任务。

I think at  a startup you don't need them.

我认为在初创公司你不需要他们。

You just need something much more simple than that,  which is here is my weekly goal and here are the tasks I want completed.

你只需要一些更简单的东西，这是我的每周目标，这里是我想要完成的任务。

 And then over the time as you build out your team and you have like  50 60 people and you need to manage that organization, OKRs are a great tool  to use.

然后随着时间的推移，当你建立你的团队，你有大约50，60人，你需要管理这个组织，OKR是一个很好的工具。

Yeah.

嗯。

Yep, back there.
Speaker 3:If you do not have product market fit and most users are turning, where should  you focus? Like [inaudible] for example?
Adora:So the question is, if you don't have product market fit and users are turning,  what should you focus on? That's a good question.

是的，在后面。演讲者3：如果您的产品不适合市场，并且大多数用户都在转向，那么您应该关注哪里？比如[听不见]？阿多拉：所以问题是，如果你的产品不适合市场，而用户正在转向，你应该关注什么？这个问题问得好。

So you should focus on definitely  finding what the problem is first.

所以你应该把重点放在确定首先找出问题所在上。

So what is the problem that you're solving and  then what is the solution to solve that problem? And in that stream of thought,  it's finding 10 users.

那么你正在解决的问题是什么，那么解决这个问题的解决方案是什么？在这股思潮中，它找到了10个用户。

Like the common advice we give is find 10 users that  really love your product.

就像我们给的普通建议一样，找到10个真正喜欢你的产品的用户。

Do that first before you start trying to grow.

在你开始尝试成长之前先做这件事。

So there  are some things that you need to do before you start, you know, trying to  scale the business.

所以，在你开始之前，你需要做一些事情，你知道，试图扩大业务。

Yep.
Speaker 4:[inaudible] B2B hard tech and my first Prudential client requires like 400 times the amount  the amount of production than I'm currently producing.

是啊。演讲者4：[听不见]B2B Hard Tech和我的第一个Prudential客户需要的产量大约是我目前产量的400倍。

How would you prioritize paying the funds?
Adora:So the question is he's running a B2B hard tech company and to get users  you just need a lot of funds to get going.
Speaker 4:I have one, I mean he needs 400 times what I can actually [crosstalk 00:18:07].

你会如何优先支付资金？阿多拉：所以问题是他在经营一家B2B硬技术公司，为了获得用户，你只需要很多资金就可以了。扬声器4：我有一个，我的意思是他需要的是我实际能力的400倍[相声00：18：07]。

 [inaudible] funds.
Adora:Okay.

[听不见]资金。好的。

So he has one user but he needs funds to deliver the amount of  product that the user wants.

所以他有一个用户，但他需要资金来交付用户想要的产品数量。

I think there's a long answer to this.

我认为这个问题有一个很长的答案。

I'm trying  to figure out the short answer.

我在试着找出简短的答案。

The long answer.

长话短说。

Well here's the short answer.

好吧，这是简短的答案。

There  is a talk in startup school from the last one with Eric Migicovsky who is  the founder of Pebble and he goes through all the steps that you should think  about before you need funding so that you have enough proof when you do go  to investors [inaudible 00:18:36].

上一次在创业学校与Pebble的创始人埃里克·米吉科夫斯基(Eric Migicovsky)进行了一次谈话，他完成了你在需要资金之前应该考虑的所有步骤，这样当你去找投资者时，你就有足够的证据[听不见的00：18：36]。

But to more directly answer your question, I think what you  want to do is start getting more customers in the sense that not delivering the  product but in the sense of getting presales or contracts.

但要更直接地回答你的问题，我认为你想要做的是开始获得更多的客户，不是交付产品，而是获得售前或合同。

Because if you get more  of the, and it would be great if they're prepaid too, because getting a prepaid  means that maybe you don't even need an investor to actually build the product.

因为如果你得到更多的，而且如果他们也是预付费的，那就太好了，因为获得预付费意味着你甚至不需要投资者来实际构建产品。

So  try to do those presales and presales shows good demand, good demand, investors love.

所以尽量做到那些售前和售前显示出良好的需求，投资者喜欢。

It  de-risks the whole entire thing for them.

它为他们消除了整个事情的风险。

And so it'd be much easier for you  to do fundraising if you can get the prepaid contracts as well, then maybe you  don't even need, you're in a much better position with investors for sure, but maybe  you don't even need them.

所以如果你也能拿到预付合同，那么你的筹款就会容易得多，那么你甚至可能不需要，你在投资者面前的地位肯定要好得多，但也许你甚至不需要他们。

All right.

好的。

Yep.

是啊。

Right here.
Speaker 5:I'm a little [inaudible] in couple of things that you said.

就在这儿。演讲者5：你说的几件事我有点[听不见]。

One mainly [inaudible] [inaudible]  rush out and pick them up and go see 10 people and started learning from  that and prioritizing your time.

一个主要是[听不见]冲出来接他们去见10个人，并开始从中学习，并优先安排你的时间。

Right? And at the very bottom you had key features  as being the ones that you took the least amount of effort, and 20% low  key activity.

对吗？在最底层，你的关键特征是你付出的努力最少，以及20%的低调活动。

But if your market is telling...

但如果你的市场告诉你.

Customers are calling you [inaudible] buy your  product [inaudible] are there.

客户打电话给你[听不见]买你的产品[听不见]都在那里。

[inaudible] that can become your priority rather than being at the  very bottom?
Adora:Okay.

[听不见]这可以成为你的优先考虑，而不是处于最底层？好的。

So I think the question is, I showed an example of which they're one  of, one of the things that was up more at the bottom was I should  build this key feature.

所以我认为问题是，我展示了一个例子，他们是其中之一，在底部的事情之一是我应该构建这个关键功能。

And so the question is why don't you build that when,  if that's what the market is telling you.

所以问题是，如果市场是这么告诉你的，你为什么不在什么时候建造它。

So the way I think about progress  in the startup is for one, not to get ahead of yourself.

所以我认为创业公司的进步就是其中之一，而不是超越自己。

So the example  I gave was, my goal is just to get five new customers.

所以我给出的例子是，我的目标只是获得五个新客户。

How am I  going to get that? Building a key feature like that might get me a thousand  customers, it might, but really, I just want to get five right now, but there  was that low probability that it might get me a thousand customers and so I  want to do the thing that are most sure to hit my weekly goal.

我怎么才能拿到那个？构建这样的关键功能可能会给我带来一千个客户，但实际上，我现在只想得到五个客户，但它可能给我带来一千个客户的可能性很低，所以我想做最有把握达到我每周目标的事情。

At  some point, my weekly goal is going to be a 1000 new customers in which  I would probably stack rank that higher.

在某个时候，我的每周目标是1000个新客户，其中我可能会堆叠更高的排名。

Now the thing on the chart, actually, let  me just go back to it, this chart, right? So what you'll see here is  that I'm coding the big feature, but what I actually have here is I'm getting  feedback from users on the big feature, so I don't really know that this is  going to do anything, but if I go talk to all my existing users and  go validate that first, then and I do validate that that's why it's medium up  here, then I can pull up this task up much, much higher.

现在图表上的东西，实际上，让我回到它，这个图表，对吗？所以你在这里看到的是我在编码这个大功能，但是我在这里实际得到的是用户对这个大功能的反馈，所以我真的不知道这会不会起到什么作用，但如果我去和所有现有的用户交谈并首先验证它，然后我确实验证了这就是为什么它在这里是中等的，然后我可以把这个任务拉到更高，更高的水平。

All right.

好的。

Yes.
Speaker 6:You've probably seen this executed a lot of times.

是。演讲者6：你可能已经看过这个执行很多次了。

Do you have any examples of  a startup kind of misinterpreting this structure? Like using it in a way that was  ultimately less helpful or like doing it in a way that wasn't necessarily helping them  get to that next small [inaudible 00:21:33]? How can this be misinterpreted? Like how do  we avoid that?
Adora:The question is how can this framework be misinterpreted and send them off in the  wrong direction.
Speaker 6:Have you seen it be misinterpreted or is this just pretty foolproof?
Adora:I think the main thing is being honest with yourself about where the current state  of your company is.

你有没有任何初创公司误解这种结构的例子？喜欢以一种最终没有帮助的方式使用它，或者以一种不一定能帮助他们达到下一个小目标的方式(听不见的00：21：33)？这怎么可能被误解呢？比如我们如何避免这种情况？Adora：问题是这个框架怎么可能被误解并把他们送往错误的方向。演讲者6：你有没有看到它被误解了，或者这仅仅是非常简单的？阿多拉：我认为最主要的事情是对自己坦诚相待，了解公司目前的状况。

What is your actual weekly goal, and how much time something  actually takes.

你的实际每周目标是什么，以及某件事情实际需要多少时间。

I think some people sometimes overestimate the time it takes, or again, they  let other types of work get in the way of the one or two things  that they need to do that week because it's just easy to do.

我认为有些人有时高估了所需的时间，或者再一次，他们让其他类型的工作妨碍了他们需要在一周内完成的一两件事情，因为这很容易做到。

So that's  what I was saying, we just get on, like our brains go on autopilot all  the time.

所以这就是我想说的，我们只是相处得很好，就像我们的大脑一直在自动驾驶。

And so the framework kind of whittles away over time and that's how  it can get a little bit wonky.
Speaker 7:Is this supposed to be like a company wide thing or is this more like  four or five[inaudible 00:22:30]
Adora:So the question is should this be a company wide thing or for like a  small team? So when I talk, this is for like really early stage startups.

所以框架会随着时间的推移逐渐变白，这就是为什么它会变得有点不稳定。演讲者7：这应该是公司范围内的事情，还是更像四个或五个[听不见的00：22：30]阿多拉：所以问题是这应该是一个公司范围的事情，还是像一个小团队？所以当我说话的时候，这是为非常早期的初创公司准备的。

You've  just launched or about to launch and you've got these weekly goals.

你刚刚启动或即将启动，并且你有这些每周目标。

I think that  these can be, this is a framework that you can use for teams also.

我认为这些可以，这是一个你也可以用于团队的框架。

So  it's a little bit hard as you have many teams in a company and the  structure gets more complex so it's a little bit hard to keep it that simple.

所以这有点困难，因为你在一个公司里有很多团队，而且结构变得更加复杂，所以保持这么简单有点困难。

 But that's, when someone mentioned about OKR is it's like a good way to kind  of structure progress in a company.

但那就是，当有人提到OKR时，它就像是一种在公司结构上取得进展的好方法。

Yeah, for sure.

是的，当然。

I'm talking about super early stage,  whatever the stage most people are in startup school.

我说的是超早期阶段，无论大多数人在初创学校处于什么阶段。

All right, two more questions.
Speaker 8:Yeah.

好了，还有两个问题。扬声器8：是的。

Do you have any metric that you can decide and decide about that it  is [inaudible] prioritizing time? Because you need more people in your team.
Adora:So the question is, is there a way to tell, like a metric to tell  whether you're, if you're not making progress, it's not because you're not prioritizing time.

您是否有任何指标可以决定并决定它是[听不到的]优先排序时间？因为你的团队需要更多的人。阿多拉：所以问题是，有没有一种方法可以告诉你，比如衡量你是否，如果你没有取得进展，这不是因为你没有优先考虑时间。

Well  it's because you're actually just, you need people, you need bodies.

嗯，那是因为你实际上只是，你需要人，你需要身体。

I think if you  go back to what I was saying like when you're evaluating all the weekly updates  and there's really no room for improvements there, then that's a sign.

我认为，如果你回到我说的话，就像你评估所有每周更新时，那里真的没有改进的空间，那么这就是一个迹象。

I do hesitate  to suggest that you just hire people to solve the problems.

我真的很犹豫是否建议你雇佣一些人来解决问题。

It might be that  case, but hopefully it's something that the founders have done themselves already and that they  can just off, like that's the thing that they need to offload versus something that  maybe software can be done like software can solve or just you know, team is  not working well together or you know, time is not being used well.

可能是这种情况，但希望这是创始人自己已经做过的事情，他们可以直接做，就像这是他们需要卸载的事情，而可能是软件可以解决的事情，或者只是你知道，团队不能很好地合作，或者你知道，时间没有得到很好的利用。

Yeah.

嗯。

All  right, last question right here.
Speaker 9:You typically advice not to buy advertising at first.

好了最后一个问题就在这里。演讲者9：你通常建议一开始不要买广告。

Just to speak with customers and  try to get those customers.

只是与客户交谈，并尝试获得这些客户。

Talking to them.

跟他们说话。

When is the right time to start  really an advertising campaign for a start up?
Adora:Okay, we at YC do not advocate you doing any kind of paid marketing like  buying ads.

什么时候才是真正开始创业广告活动的合适时机？阿多拉：好的，我们YC不提倡你做任何形式的付费营销，比如购买广告。

And so the question is obviously there is at some point there's a  right time for this and one is the right time.

所以问题是，很明显，在某一点上，有一个合适的时机，一个就是正确的时机。

So for us what we  say is the right time is usually when you have product market fit and you're  ready to scale and you've already done the experiments necessary to show that your CAC  is reasonable for whatever the revenue is coming during the per user basis.

所以对我们来说，我们说的是正确的时间通常是当你有产品市场适合的时候，你已经准备好进行扩展，并且你已经做了必要的实验来证明你的CAC对于每个用户的收入来说是合理的。

Usually what  we see, when we say don't do paid advertising, what we really, really, really mean  is what we...

通常我们看到的，当我们说不要做付费广告的时候，我们真正的意思是我们.

The mistake that people make is to get the first hundred users  or the first, even first 10 users they got the go buy a lot of  ads and I think it's a reflection of bad, usually a bad founder market fit  if you don't know where to find those first 10 users, especially if it's a  consumer company.

人们所犯的错误是获得前100个用户或前10个用户购买大量广告，我认为这反映了糟糕的，通常是不好的创始人市场匹配，如果你不知道在哪里找到前10个用户，特别是如果它是一家消费公司的话。

But even for a B2B type enterprise company, hopefully you have talked to  at least all those kinds of users and you are building, you've built something in  which someone has at least committed to using the product and paying for the product.

但即使是对于B2B类型的企业公司，希望您至少已经与所有这些类型的用户进行了交谈，并且您正在构建，您已经构建了一些东西，其中至少有人承诺使用产品并为产品付费。

 Cool.

很好。

All right.

好的。

Okay.

好吧。

Last question.
Speaker 10:[crosstalk] teams trying to do everything [inaudible]
Adora:That's a good question.

最后一个问题。扬声器10：[相声]尝试做所有事情的团队[听不见]阿多拉：这是个好问题。

So should we follow up with our team to make sure  we're all on track? I think weekly stand ups are great.

那么，我们是否应该与我们的团队一起跟进，以确保我们都走上了正轨？我认为每周的脱口秀很棒。

It depends on how,  I don't know, like for a 100% company.

这取决于如何，我不知道，就像一个100%的公司。

That's too many for [inaudible 00:00:26:14], but  say four or five, six person team weekly stamps are great.

这对于[听不见的00：00：26：14]来说太多了，但是说四五个，六个人的团队每周的邮票是很棒的。

Some people would do  daily stand ups or some people do even two stand ups a day.

有些人会每天做站立，有些人甚至一天做两次站立。

Personally I  think those are not as effective because to make progress, it takes time.

我个人认为这些都不是很有效，因为要取得进展，需要时间。

And so  even if you are making progress, it's hard to see it like in one day  chunks.

因此，即使你正在取得进步，也很难在一天的时间里看到它。

But for sure one week stand ups are great.

但可以肯定的是，一周的站起来是很棒的。

And reviewing this with everybody  and getting everyone on the same page.

和每个人一起回顾这件事，让每个人都站在同一页上。

Getting everyone on the same page in your  company, by the way, on the definition of your primary KPI is super important.

顺便说一句，让公司里的每个人都同意你的主要KPI的定义是非常重要的。

You'll  be surprised how many companies where team members just have varying levels of definition.

你会惊讶于有多少公司的团队成员只有不同级别的定义。

And  then once you get that set, then having everyone understand what the goals of the  company are and then what are the tasks we should be working on.

然后，一旦你得到了这个集合，然后让每个人都明白公司的目标是什么，然后我们应该做什么工作。

So cool.

太酷了。

 All right.
Speaker 11:Thanks Adora.


好的。演讲者11：谢谢，阿多拉。
